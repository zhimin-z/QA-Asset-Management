        "Question_body":"Domino 4.4 introduced Resumable Workspaces. In our environment the maximum number of workspaces per user is limited to 8. When this limit is reached, I have to delete one of my workspaces first, so that I can create a new one.\u00a0\n\nA user asked the following question in our legacy community system:\n\nI would have expected to see, for example, in the project overview or in the Control Center in which projects my 8 user workspaces are, so that I can specifically archive workspaces that are no longer needed. So I have to go through all my projects and manually check where workspaces exist.\u00a0\n\nDid I miss something? Is there a place where I as a Data Scientist can see in which projects I currently have how many workspaces?\n\nAnswering below.\u00a0\n\nThank you very much for your feedback.",
