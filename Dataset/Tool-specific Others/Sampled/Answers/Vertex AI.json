Is there a way for me to avoid incurring the added size increase?Please note that my job loads the training data using the `datasets` Python package at run time and AFAIK does not include it in the auto-packaged docker image.

Also there is a problem with translating pages or similar plugins, e.g.: Google Language Translator for WordPress and some others CMS system like Kopage you can translate only to Serbian Cyrillic script.As I found this post on stackoverflow:\nhttps:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/73699065\/google-cloud-translate-serbian-latin-not-workingIt seems, according to the poster of that article, that there was a workaround.\nInstead of \"sr\" ISO-639 code you can put \"sr_Latn\" - and you will get translation into Serbian Latin script.\nBut that workaround stop working several weeks ago - according to the poster.Is there a workaround to translate into Serbian Latin characters rather into Serbian Cyrillic characters?Regards,\nBranislav",

Specifically, i get '400 bad request' with no information on why it was a bad request.I am using the v1beta1 ai platform python SDK and also am using a custom basic serving container.

For example if I type in google search python, I will get python programming language, while my mum will snake.

We've also confirmed that it works with a different Service account that my colleague set up in his personal Google console profile. But, we need this setup with an account through our org. I did verify that the service account has the permission from the https:\/\/console.cloud.google.com\/iam-admin\/troubleshooter so and that my organization's admin sees that the service account is granted access through ancestor policies.  So what else can we check? ",
