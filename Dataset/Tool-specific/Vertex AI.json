This will be my first time using GCP so I would like to be careful so that I don't get billed hundreds of dollars.\u00a0\n\nWith that out of the way, I could use some help.

The problem is, the 100k dataset is far to big for colab's gpus. This led me to find GCP which provides essentially free GPU's with its $300 credit free trial. This leads me to the true problem, I have no idea how I would go about running this colab file (or the code in general) with GCP's GPU's. I've looked at a couple tutorials already, and many of them talk about port-forwarding jupyter things and whatnot which I have no idea how to use. Does anyone have\/know about good tutorials which go really in depth (like for complete and total dummies (also preferably a video)) of how to essentially run my colab file, or is anyone willing to step by step work with me to get this done?\n\nThanks,\n\nFrank",

Upload a pretrained image_quality.pb model (developed in a non vertex-ai pythonic environment) in a gcs bucket\n\n2. Port existing image inference logic into a container and serve the prediction functionality through a vertex AI endpoint.\u00a0\n\n3. Use Vertex AI api for logging and capturing metrics inside the \u00a0custom inference logic.\n\n4. Finally we want to pass a list of images (stored in another gcs bucket) to that endpoint.\n\n5. We also want to see the logs and metrics in tensorboard.\n\nExisting Vertex AI code samples provide examples for custom training , invoking model.batch_predict \/ endpoint.predict , but don't mention how to execute custom prediction code.\n\nIt would be great if someone can provide guidelines and links to documents\/code in order to implement the above steps.\n\nThanks",

Even if it is utilized in your description of the form parameter, the error notice implicates that '@sys.unit-currency' is an unknown entity type.\n\nHere are some possible solutions that might involve your issue:\n\nVerify '@sys.unit-currency's spelling and formatting once again. Ensure that it is a perfect match to the entity type utilized by the system entities.\nVerify that your Dialogflow CX agent has the '@sys.unit-currency' entity type enabled. You may accomplish this by visiting the Entities page and making sure the switch is turned on next to \"@sys.unit-currency.\"\n\n\nTry redeploying your agent if you recently added or modified the '@sys.unit-currency' entity type, by doing this, you may help verify that your entity type is being used as of late.\n\n\nTry generating the form parameter again using a different entity type and checking to see if the issue still occurs.\n\nHere are some documentation that might help you:\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/dialogflow\/es\/docs\/reference\/system-entities?_ga=2.213766740.-1392753435.16...\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/dialogflow\/es\/docs\/entities-options?_ga=2.213766740.-1392753435.1676655686\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/dialogflow\/cx\/docs\/reference\/system-functions?_ga=2.104734656.-1392753435.1...\n\nView solution in original post",

I am not sure if .cpickle is supportive for them or not.\n\nSo my query is in which format I can save the model so that mobile team can easily integrate it with the Android app. I know about the TFLite format but how can I convert the model to this format or is there any other way?\n\nPlease share your thoughts on this.",

I need to gather some information on start so that I can identify the hotel\/property that will be referenced in the conversation.\u00a0 I found session parameters but those are isolated to the session from start to finish but not passed to the start of a session. We are starting with about 60 properties and when the agent starts, it needs to \"know\" what property it is dealing with.\u00a0\n\nAnother quick question - will I need a separate telephony integration number to run multiple concurrent instances?\u00a0\n\nI am really new to all this so my language may be off. Thanks in advance!!\n\nRobert",

For example, over the past 3 months, some players will have a sample size of 28 while some will only have 2. Those players that have 28 rounds will have more accurate averages than those with 2. However, I didn't know whether google automl tables would pick up this link automatically, whether I could create a different weighting\/reliability variable, or whether there's a way to specify a link between columns?

This is because the `gcloud ml speech recognize` tool uses the older `v1` version of the Speech-to-Text API, which doesn't support setting boost levels for hints or phrases.\n\nHowever, you can use the REST API directly to set boost levels for hints and phrases. You can do this by creating a RecognitionConfig JSON object with the appropriate boost levels, and passing it to the Speech-to-Text API via a POST request. You can use a program like `curl` or `httpie` to send a `POST` request to the Speech-to-Text API with this `RecognitionConfig`JSON object.To use the boost capability, you must activate the Speech-to-Text API's `v1p1beta1` version.\n\nHere are some documentations you may use as a reference:\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/speech-to-text\/docs\/quickstart-client-libraries#before-you-begin\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/speech-to-text\/docs\/adaptation-model?_ga=2.149903862.-1392753435.1676655686\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/sdk\/gcloud\/reference\/alpha\/ml\/speech\/recognize?_ga=2.149903862.-1392753435....\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/speech-to-text\/docs\/reference\/rest\/v1p1beta1\/projects.locations.phraseSets?...\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/speech-to-text\/docs\/best-practices-provide-speech-data?_ga=2.149903862.-139...\n\n\u00a0\n\nView solution in original post",

I also tried that, but I think google is trying to get rid of AI platform, and although I succesfully uploaded the model, it doesn't allow me to make a new version, basically allows me nothing.\n\n2. I tried to work this tutorial,\u00a0https:\/\/codelabs.developers.google.com\/vertex-p2p-predictions#5\u00a0\n\nand it keeps complaining that my payload is above 1.5MB limit, but my image is only 49KB, so it's ridiculous. maybe something happened in this code, but it's from the tutorial, so the tutorial must be wrong then.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIMAGE_PATH = \"test-image.jpg\"\nim = Image.open(IMAGE_PATH)\nx_test = np.asarray(im).astype(np.float32).tolist()\nendpoint.predict(instances=x_test).predictions\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. Last, I've been trying to call the API from the sample code,\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/googleapis\/python-aiplatform\/blob\/main\/samples\/snippets\/prediction_service\/predic...\n\nbut it gives me a json format error.\n\nI have referenced from this website to get the json format.\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/googleapis\/python-aiplatform\/blob\/main\/samples\/snippets\/prediction_service\/predic...\u00a0\n\nThe error I am getting is as is :\u00a0\n\n400 { \"error\": \"Failed to process element: 0 key: instances of 'instances' list.

My experience with GCP and vertex AI is very disappointing and I'm considering to explore other options. Please let me know if any of you have any advices. Thanks",

        "Question_body":"Dear ALL;\n\nI have made a sales and demand forecasting autoML model. It trained well and is working. I am looking for a way to format input data for batch prediction forecasting where I would like to do more than one forecast horizon predictions.\n\nBasically my model uses monthly data granularity with 12 month context length and 6 month forecast horizon. (I have 15 covariate features and predict for 14 separate identifiers).\n\nWhat I would like to do is configure the input data for a batch forecasting where the forecasting would start 3 month earlier than where the feature data end and make forecasts for these three time periods AND when the feature data ends do the normal 6 month forecasting so I end up with 3 month forecasting where I know the actuals and the normal 6 month forecasting.\n\nAt this point no matter how I format my input data I only get the 6 month forecast horizon.\n\nThanks",

Here is a complete guide that you can follow.\nI do not see any Python wrapper for CUDA in your code. The way you specify when to use the GPU for specific tasks is through this wrapper, it seems to me that you are using the CPU instead and that is why the task keeps crashing. Now, converting your code to a CUDA version is not a trivial task, and it involves a deeper knowledge on how a GPU works. If you are in a hurry, you could try the Py2CUDA github project, but I would strongly recommend taking a look at the Getting Started Blogs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nView solution in original post",

It is currently in beta and is available to a limited number of users. You can sign up for the waitlist on the Google AI website.\n\nThe Google Bard API allows you to access the power of Google's large language models to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.\n\nYou can use the Google Bard API to create a variety of applications, including:\n\nChatbots that can hold conversations with users\nGenerators that can create content for websites and social media\nTranslators that can translate text from one language to another\nAnswerers that can answer questions about a variety of topics\n\nTo use the Google Bard API, you will need to create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the Google Bard API. You will then need to create a service account and download the JSON key file.\n\nOnce you have done this, you can start using the Google Bard API in your applications.

I have followed these instructions, and can correctly create an instance schedule, but it seems I can only attach it to regular VMs, i.e., VMs listed under the \"instances\" of my project. Is there a way around this?\n\nThanks!",

        "Question_body":"I'm from Ukraine. Therefore, I write with the help of a translator. I immediately apologize for any mistakes.\n\nI am a doctor. I am interested in many areas of science that are related to medicine. But because of their volume and complexity, it is impossible to learn by one person.\n\nI propose to create an AI that will analyze information on the Internet (video lectures, articles, books, audio books, images ...) and find relationships. For example, the electrophysical properties of DNA are analyzed through all known theories of physics. And a concrete example: Academician P. Garyaev's \"Linguistic Wave Genome\" through V. Atsyukovsky's \"Ether Theory\".\n\nThis tool needs to be made multifunctional and accessible to all users. This will revolutionize science by combining all knowledge.\nIt is important that there is a convenient voice interface and a personal account where studies are saved.\n\nThank you for attention.

So we started allowing \"racy\".\n\nI want to know what category \"child porn\" and \"inappropriately dressed children\" images are flagged as. We had one instance where a user uploaded child porn images that could have been interpreted as a scantily clad pre-teen\/baby. Will images like that be flagged as \"adult\" or \"racy\"?\n\nI want to make sure that by denying images moderated as \"adult\" (VERY_LIKELY), that we will be able to detect & filter out images that are:\n\n1. Child porn that includes sex\n2. Child porn that includes no sex but inappropriately dressed children\n3. Nude photos of children in any pose (even if it's something like a baby being powdered or diapered)\n4. Clothed children in inappropriate poses\n\nFurthermore, I'm curious if there's an option to detect \"offensive\" images such as violent vomiting or literal toilet\/diarrhea photos, etcetera. Which of the existing labels would detect those kind of images (if any)? If those images are not detectable with Cloud Vision Safe Search API, what are our best options?\n\nThank you for your help, as this is very important to us.\n\nI look forward to your reply.",

I am working with \"Tabular\" - \"Forecasting\" and currently struggling with few things and i hope you can help me in order i can continue. I tried to organize my questions to three categories:\n\n1) Datasets for training:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a) \"series identifier\" define to which time series data are belonging ... lets assume that i have two series identifier - one is called \"A\" and one is called \"B\". Does this means that AI treats them as completely separate and noncorrelated - this means any data that belongs to series A don't have any correlation to B, right? This give me possibility to train different dataset with one shot right? Otherwise i would need to make (in my case) two trainings - one for A and one for B.\n\n2) Training new model --> Model details\n\na) Is possible to predict more then one target column?\u00a0\n\nb) lets assume that my dataset data granularity is 1 day. Can i use data granularity of \"5min\" for Forecast configuration or can this setup decrease quality of my forecast? Should it be more correct to use already at beginning lets say dataset granularity of 5 minute and afterwards it could be more flexible when setting data granularity for forecast configuration without influencing forecast quality?\n\nc) If I set Forecast horizon of 7 and context window 30, does this means that this setting limit my forecast to maximum 7 time steps and requesting always exactly 30 time steps of historical data as input when forecasting on existing trained model?\n\n3) Batch predictions\n\na) Batch Source file\n\nLets assume that i have data with 15 columns from which one is \"serial identifier\" , one is \"time step\" - actually date and one of those columns is target column. Rest of 12 columns are used as influencer and used to train my model. I know that i need to have same structure for batch source file - i read that i can use same file as i used for training, but i just need to add in my case a 2x7 new rows with adding 7 dates and serial identification (in my case 7x A and 7xB) and target column need to be empty. But what should i do with data of rest 12 columns? Do i need manually to enter data for those new rows (2x7) of those 12 columns which values should be for future? But what if i don't have those data? Does this means i cannot do prediction?\n\nI tried to make prediction without those future data and i got following message:\n\n\"There are rows with non-empty target values after this row. The time series has been excluded from predictions.\"\n\nI hope you can help me with above questions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTnx in advance!\n\n\u00a0\n\nRegards,\n\n\u00a0\n\nArny",

I then added back in the \"alpha\" option after gcloud, this accepted the mp3 encoding but again returned the defective JSON transcrption file.\n\nIt would really be a massive inconvenience to have to use the GUI to submit jobs one at a time.\u00a0\n\nI went to the S2T \"What's new\" page and it didn't make any reference that seemed to explain this.

        "Question_body":"Hi,\n\nI am trying to run my ML model in Colab utilizing a custom VM with multiple GPUs. I can successfully spin up a 2 GPU DeepLearning VM and connect to a Colab notebook via port-forwarding to a locally-hosted connection (Jupyter Notebook), as shown here.\n\nAlthough I can connect to custom runtimes directly WITHOUT port-forwarding to a locally-hosted connection, I can only access 1 of the 2 GPUs this way (i.e.\u00a0\n\nlen(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) always returns 1); hence, I'm tied to port-forwarding, unless there's an alternative option.\n\nI can successfully connect to a locally-hosted, port-forwarded runtime and verify that the notebook can access the 2 GPUs; however I am running into issues when trying to mount my Google Drive.\n\nI know that ocamlfuse was offered as a suggestion to this Drive issue,\u00a0 however, none of the download options work. Specifically, it seems like a locally-hosted port-forwarded runtime doesn't allow terminal inputs, so I can't \"Press [ENTER]\" to allow the download, as shown below:\n\nUser import cursor shows up for a direct connection to a custom or hosted runtime:\n\nUser import cursor fails to show up\/accept inputs in a locally-hosted, port-forwarded custom VM.\n\nIn general, it seems like terminal commands don't work in Colab in a locally-hosted runtime.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother option is\u00a0PyDrive, which I've used in the past. However, since\u00a0PyDrive\u00a0relies on authentication through a local port, I can't get it to work on my locally-hosted custom VM.\n\nIn short I'm looking for tips\/suggestions for any of the following issues:\n\n1) An alternative workflow to run my ML model using multiple GPUs (i.e. that's not through port-forwarding to a locally-hosted connection)\n\n2) How to get that user cursor to show up (enabling me to download\u00a0ocamlfuse)\n\n3) How to authenticate in PyDrive, given I'm already using a local port connection to host my runtime.\n\n4) Alternatives to accessing my Drive\/Drive files.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you so much!",

The job successfully started (as evident by the logs reported) but at some point, just before the script starts using the GPU on the machine, we stopped receving any logs. I let the job run for 20 minutes, but it did not procide any more logs - as well as there was no indication of the machine having any issues.\u00a0 I then stopped the job manually,\u00a0 re-created the exact same job by running the same script (using the google-cloud-aiplatform package in Python) with the exact same parameters, and the job ran successfully.\n\nIs there any way I can figure out what went wrong in the first job? I am looking for a stable solution to manage custom jobs, but the fact that this happened within my first 5 runs seems very concerning to me, especially since there was no indication that the job was frozen as it could have ran until it hit the max time which would have costed a lot of money.\n\nThanks!",

This is all done programmatically through the Dialogflow APIs, which I am on v2 of.\n\nMy deployment process first is deploying which uses the: \"agentClient.restoreAgent();\"\u00a0function within the api. (This is a node app)\n\nThen I after successfully uploading the new content, I train the agent: \"agentClient.trainAgent();\"\n\nThis process has not changed for quite a long time and this issue has only recently started and has gradually gotten worse.\n\nTo describe the issues further, when I deploy all steps come through as successful and done, leading me to believe the agent has been properly uploaded and trained with the training successful and complete. I then go the chat with the bot\/agent and get the below error in my console. This persists for a fair few minutes now (around 5 minutes) before the messages are successfully handled and the intent is recognised correctly. As mentioned, nothing has changed for a long time in my code for how we deploy, train and chat to a Dialogflow agent.\n\nThis is quite a serious issue since it also effects client production apps as well as my own development environment, and its not great for clients to deploy then be told it is successful from Dialogflow and then still have to wait another 5 minutes because of this error Dialogflow gives for the bot to actually be usable.\n\nOne other thing worth noting, is that this error also occurs on the Dialogflow test console on the Dialogflow site (https:\/\/dialogflow.cloud.google.com\/) so it is not something unique to my app. I.e. after I deploy, I try and test here and the same issue I get in my app occurs on the official Dialogflow console.\n\nAnother extra point, this is not on\u00a0every deployment, but it is on most of them now.\n\nThanks!\n\nImage of error on Dialogflow itself:\n\n\u00a0\n\nError:\n\n\u00a0\n\nError: 9 FAILED_PRECONDITION: Intent with id '<UUID here>' not found among intents in environment '' for agent with id '<UUID here>'.   \ncom.google.apps.framework.request.StatusException: <eye3 title='FAILED_PRECONDITION'\/> generic::FAILED_PRECONDITION: Intent with id '<UUID here>' not found among intents in environment '' for agent with id '<UUID here>'.",

The chatbot has to go on to ask what the project name should be, and when delivery is wanted.\n\nInput 2 can detect the intent and pick out the projectName in one go. But in the Dialogflow CX console, I cannot mix Input 2 phrases and input 1 phrases, so that projectName is optionally extracted from input. Once I start with an annotated training phrase, the intent editor seems to demand that every subsequent training phrase includes the same entity to be extracted. It automatically annotates every phrase with the entity, and I cannot delete the annotation from the training phrase.\n\nIt seems I cannot mix annotated and unannotated training phrases in one intent. Is that true? Anyway, I can try and work around this by creating two intents, one that requires the parameter to be defined in the input, and one that does not.\n\nBut then we come to input 3. The user can specify delivery date too. So now I have two optional parameters, either of which might be present in the input. That means I now have to have four different intents with training phrases for the four options of zero, one or two parameters in the input. And then if I have another optional parameter, I need eight different intents...\n\nIs that the way to do it?",

However I have two concerns regarding its budget limiting, in order to not get an unexpected bill:\n\nIs it possible to set a monthly cost limit? I have been used to Compute Engine which gives me an almost exact cost of the month but this seems not possible here. Since I will be using the API for labelling I have set the label detections requests per minute and per user to a specific amount, also to be sure I have set the global request per minute and per user to the same amount, all the other quotas to 0. If I have understood correctly, setting the max calls quota per minute to 4, for example, should provide a maximum of 178560 calls per month, right?\u00a0Should this limit my budget? Am I safe?\n\nThe API will be used as an API key in a mobile app. I have followed the code examples for iOS & Android and I have seen the key is written in the code. Is this safe? For a better security I have restricted the key to iOS\/Android apps bundle and to Cloud Vision API only. Would it be a safe enough option?\n\nThanks everyone for any help!",

But if you already set up your instance, you just need to enable IAP Enabling IAP for Compute Engine.\" Given that my VM instance had already been set up, I jumped (at the suggestion of the person advising me) to the part of the document dealing with \"Enabling IAP for Compute Engine\" without carrying out the other steps for persons who did not already have an up and running VM instance (i.e., load balancing, etc.) While following the steps listed in the documentation, I discovered I must activate the \"Configure consent screen\" button and create an OAuth consent screen. None of the things I saw after this point seemed to have anything to with my sort of project, that involves no one but myself to give consent to.\u00a0 But I decided this time not to \"think too hard\" and to simply follow the instructions. After several long, puzzling minutes trying to do what I thought I was supposed to do, I submitted my OAuth request. And after 48 hours or so of waiting for an answer from the Trust & Safety Security & Privacy Team, I just received a Request Denied from them, with no explanation of what was wrong with my submission (though I'm sure several things were), along with a warning that I might need to submit a video. But of what? Perhaps it's worth mentioning at this point that what I wish to do is \"simply\" use Google Cloud Translation (Advanced) with a glossary in .tmx format to translate a .docx file from one Google-supported human language to another Google-supported human language, outputting the result also in .docx format and storing both in different subdirectories of my bucket. (One directory for the .docx input file and another for the .docx output file, the result of the translation.) My main question is this: is it even necessary to create an OAuth consent screen in such a scenario,\u00a0 with only person (i.e. me) accessing my VM via the GC console? And if a consent screen turns out to be a necessity, can someone please suggest what I might do to get things right this time and not receive a second Request Denied from the members of the Trust & Safety Security & Privacy Team?",

I created a custom entity type for the project name, a regex, called projectNameText,\u00a0 and created a training phrase:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I want to order a new project called Annabel\"\n\nand I annotated the training phrase so that Annabel was labelled as a projectNameText entity, all in the DialogFlow-CX console, as described in the documentation.\u00a0But that instantly creates a parameter with Parameter id projectNameText. And I cannot edit that Parameter id. I can't require that when Dialogflow matches that training phrase and extracts an entity of type projectNameText, it puts it into the parameter projectName. Dialogflow demands that it goes into a parameter called projectNameText, or projectNameText1 if there is more than one. When I run the simulator and type input that matches that training phrase, Dialogflow does indeed correctly extract the entity, but will only create a parameter named projectNameText - I can see the name and value in the simulator.\n\nThis StackOverflow answer implies that I can send the matched entity into any parameter I want. That would be sensible. But how do I do it? I can't find any way to edit the parameter name in the Intent editor.

Listed below are some possible solutions to the problem:\u00a0\n\n1. If you are using an API to import data into datasets unlike in legacy (AutoML) where you are using CSV file to specify the location of the source file in CGS, in native (Cloud Translation) you need to specify the locations of TSV and TMX files in CGS. You can learn more about the difference of legacy and native resources using this link:\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/translate\/docs\/advanced\/automl-upgrade#differences_between_legacy_and_nativ...\n\n2. You need to update your code to use the Cloud Translation API and call the native resource IDs not the legacy resource IDs, although legacy and native are identical they don't have the same resource IDs, same goes for newly created resources and translation predictions where you must use Cloud Translation API rather than\u00a0AutoML API. You can check these documentations to learn more:\n\u00a0https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/translate\/docs\/advanced\/automl-upgrade#cloud-translation-api\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/translate\/docs\/advanced\/translating-text-v3\nhttps:\/\/cloud.google.com\/translate\/docs\/advanced\/automl-models\n\n\n3. You need to attach the necessary roles in order for the service account to work correctly. To learn more about the necessary roles, you can check this link.\u00a0https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/translate\/docs\/intro-to-v3#iam\nIf you are also using the features of GCS or AutoML models, you need to include the necessary roles to the service account.\u00a0\n\n4. Verify your dataset to ensure it is in the proper format and has sufficient data to train the model. To see if the training procedure begins, you may also try uploading a smaller dataset.\n\nHope it helps!\n\n\nView solution in original post",

During training, I checked the option to \"Export test dataset to BigQuery.\" I have a question about how to understand the data that appears in the exported table.\n\nMy understanding is that a \"predicted_on\" timestamp is essentially the first date of the forecast horizon of a rolling forecast window. I see that for each \"predicted_on\" timestamp, there are 6 timestamps from the test data split of my training data. This suggests that the forecast horizon is 6 weeks long; i.e., for each \"predicted_on\" date (and starting on that date) it predicts 6 weeks of data.\n\nMy question is, where does the number 6 come from? (When I trained the model, I specified that the forecast horizon is 26 weeks, not 6...)",

I changed the format of my timestamps. I also ensured that every number in my target column has a decimal (it was previously a mix of integers and decimal numbers).\n\nAfter making these changes, I trained a new model and examined the data exported to BigQuery.\n\nNow I see that there are 26 weeks of timestamps from the test data split associated with the first\u00a0`predicted_on` timestamp. This would suggest that the forecast horizon of the rolling forecast window is 26 weeks long. This is what I would expect, given that I set the forecast horizon to 26 when I trained the model.\n\nView solution in original post",

Using AutoML Tables - would I need to structure the data in a tabular form with many columns? Or is there a better way to tackle this problem.\n\nHere is an example of the data I would be using:\n\nRace:\n\nExample data for each Greyhound in the race:\n\n\u00a0\n\nDoes anyone please have any advice of how to tackle this kind of problem, and how best to structure the data to attempt to predict the winning chance of each Greyhound for that day's race, based on that greyhound's previous data, compared to the other greyhounds in that day's race?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks,\nRob",
