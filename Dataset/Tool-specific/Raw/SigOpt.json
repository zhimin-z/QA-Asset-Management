		"Question_body": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>I was wondering if there is an \u201cearly stop\u201d feature for the SigOpt optimization: something that would stop the Experiment once a user provided value for a given metric is satisfied (ie. if our metric is \u2018time\u2019, then the experiment would stop before it runs out of budget, as soon as any of it\u2019s run achieves a \u2018time\u2019 metric below a defined value.)<br>\nI looked at the API Reference documentation and didn\u2019t find any similar feature so I started working on a separate python script that sends a query to the API and pulls the best runs from the given experiment (via the use of sigopt.get_experiment(experiment_id).get_best_runs() method).<br>\nFrom there it is easy to write custom logic based on the pulled data, however I cannot find an elegant way to close the Experiment (if I find the best run data to be good enough). The only way I was able to pull it off is via the use of sigopt.archive_experiment([experiment ID]). This will cause an error in the currently running optimization job, as the sigopt won\u2019t be able to log any run data to an archived experiment (that\u2019s ok - this is the behaviour I\u2019m looking for), however it also means that the Experiment is moved to the archived section (not great, would prefer to keep it in the main view). If there was an API call to just close the given experiment (without moving it to archive) it would be great!<br>\nIs there any missing API call that I missed that would enable such functionality?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
