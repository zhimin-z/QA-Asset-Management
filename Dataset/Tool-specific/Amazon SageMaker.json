        "Answer_body":"I can think of the following scenarios \n\nPipemode cons\n\n** UPDATED**\n\n1.  Data Shuffling -  In pipe mode you are working with streaming data and hence you cannot perform data shuffle operations unless you are prepared to shuffle within batches (as in wait to read a batch of records and shuffle within the batch in Pipe mode). Of if your data is distributed across multiples files, then you could use [Sagemaker data shuffle][1] to perform file level shuffle\n\n2.  Data readers -   There are default data readers for pipemode that come with Tensorflow for formats like csv, tfrecord etc. But if you have custom data formats or using a  different deep leaning  framework, yYou would have to use custom data readers to deal with the raw bytes and understand the logical end of record. You could also use [ml-io][2] to see if any of the built-in pipe mode readers work for your usecase\n\n3. PIPE mode streams the data for each epoch from S3 and hence will be slower than FSX when you run a few epochs\n\n\nFSX:\n\n1. FSX works by lazy loading the  s3 file and hence it has a start up delay but gets faster during repeated training. \n\n2. There is no  dependency on the framework and your existing code will work as is..\n\n3. The only con of using FSX is the additional storage costs, but I would almost prefer FSX to pipe mode in most cases.\n\n\n  [1]: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_ShuffleConfig.html\n  [2]: https:\/\/github.com\/awslabs\/ml-io#Python",

        "Question_body":"Hi! My team and I have the following scenario: we want to extract some fields from several PDF documents, that may or may not follow the same pattern. To exemplify, let's say we want to extract these 3 fields from these documents:\n\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMRcmS97dmRTm4ZhZJRzLkbQ)\n\nSo, we have a Name, a Code (called CNPJ) for this person, and its Address. Obviously, these fields would vary between documents, but the CNPJ would always keep its format, only changing the sequence of numbers. During our research to solve this challenge, we came across Amazon Comprehend and its Custom Named Entity Recognition. Our idea was to create these three entities - Name, CNPJ and Address - using a Ground Truth Labeling Job.\n\nTo do this, we Textracted some of our PDF's, generating .txt files for each one of them, and then uploaded these files to an S3 Bucket. After that, we proceeded to create the Labeling Job, using an Automated data setup to generate the input manifest file so the labeling could start. And what happened was that as I inputted many .txt files, each line in these files got recognized as a separate object, resulting in more than 7700 objects to be labeled. Of course, approximately 90% of these objects didn't had any labeling to be done, resulting in me having to continuously skip these lines until I had to label one of those objects, and also in a very high money cost due to the high number of objects.\n\nSo, I have a few questions. For starters, was Amazon Comprehend a good choice for this job? If it wasn't, what would be the best solution?\nIf it was a good choice, what could I have done to optimize the labeling job? Were the \"useless\" objects really necessary?",

I am running my code on SageMaker, which runs my code slowly for the first time, but runs with proper speed, the second time around (I guess there's something getting stored in the cache). Few days back, it was running with the same speed all the time. Whatever I run, be it a model (The model which took just 5 minutes for one epoch when it worked fine estimates 3 hours of running time) \/ just a code reading the data present in my files, it runs too slow. What could be a possible solution for this? I tried changing the notebook instance types as well, but in vain. I've been struggling for 2 days. It'll be great if someone could help me out a bit soon so that I progress ahead in my project. Thanks in advance!  \n  \nEdited by: vbsrinivasan on Jun 10, 2020 10:47 AM",

As per AWS documentation (https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com...] \"Multi-model endpoints are not supported on GPU instance types\".\nI see we are using 'instance_type': 'ml.m5.2xlarge' to train both image classification and sign language digit classification models in this post.\n\nAs per instance configuration we don't have any GPU cores and GPU memory available in 'ml.m5.2xlarge' instance type.\nBut we all know that we need a GPU instance for deep learning model training, we are not getting how we are able to train both classification models using 'ml.m5.2xlarge' instance type.\n\nDoes this image - IMAGE_URI = '763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-eas... has GPU cores?\n\nml.m5.2xlarge - Instance details:\n\nCompute Type: Standard Instances\nV CPU: 8\nMemory: 32 GiB\nClock Speed: undefined\nGPU: 0\nNetwork Performance: Up to 10 Gigabit\nStorage: EBS only\nGPU Memory: 0\n\n2. As mentioned in this post, I believe we have one production variant of both CIFAR and sign-language models meaning we have v1 models.\nLet's assume that we have a new set of images for classification then we have decided to train a new variant CIFAR model and want to create that model.\n\nSo we have 2 versions of the CIFAR model and 1 version of the sign-language model.\n\nHow can we get the inference from two production variants of CIFAR models?\nHow can we do A\/B testing for CIFAR models?\n\nThanks in advance.",

The objective I choose to minimize is validaiton:mae with \"Bayesian\" optimization strategy.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Why does each training job associated with the tuning job have a 'minimum', 'maximum', 'average', 'std-dev' of the metrics? I do not perform any cross-validation in my custom training script, so where does sagemaker get these numbers?\n2. Why does the validation error that the metrics table log the minimum value? and not the average value? How does this not lead to overfitting if we drive the tuning objective to minimum while selecting the minimum error split from internal cross-validation.\n\nPlease help me understand what's going on in sagemaker hyper-parameter tuning metric logs and objective tuning.

        "Answer_body":"Thanks for raising this. Yes, as you point out the `Environment` collection is not supported in the underlying `CreateHyperparameterTuningJob` API and therefore the SageMaker Python SDK can't make use of it when running a tuner.\n\nAs discussed on the [SM Py SDK GitHub issue here](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-python-sdk\/issues\/2934), you might consider using hyperparameters instead to pass parameters through to the job?\n\nIf you specifically need environment variables for some other process\/library, you could also explore [setting the variables from your Python script](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/5971326) (perhaps to map from hyperparam to env var?).\n\nOr another option could be to customize your container image to bake in the variable via the [ENV command](https:\/\/docs.docker.com\/engine\/reference\/builder\/#env)? For example to customize an existing AWS Deep Learning Container (framework container), you could:\n\n- Use `sagemaker.image_uris.retrieve(...)` to find the base image URI for your given framework, version, region, etc. You'll need to [authenticate Docker to this registry](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AmazonECR\/latest\/userguide\/getting-started-cli.html#cli-authenticate-registry) as well as your own Amazon ECR account.\n- Create a Dockerfile that takes this base image URI as an arg and builds `FROM` it, something like [this example](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-textract-transformer-pipeline\/blob\/b95b62cd2abd304ee347cacdd3eaf2a76e8b5953\/notebooks\/custom-containers\/train-inf\/Dockerfile)\n- Add the required `ENV` commands to bake in the (static) environment variables you need\n- `docker build` your custom container (passing in the base image URI as a `--build-arg`), upload it to Amazon ECR, and use in your SageMaker training job.",

        "Answer_comment_body":"Hi Alex! It was my mistake to use the generic Model. After switching to sagemaker.tensorflow.model.TensorFlowModel and following your suggestion (first point) to use CreateModelStep, it worked :) Many thanks!!!\nI wonder, though, why in some examples the training image is used as the Model's image_uri like e.g., the one in this link: https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/amazon_sagemaker_model_building_pipeline.html",
        "Answer_body":"Hi, the problem here is that your inference model's container URI `763104351884.dkr.ecr.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com\/tensorflow-training:2.8-cpu-py39` is using a **training** image, not an **inference** image for TensorFlow. Because the images are each optimized for their own function, the serving executable is not available in the training container in this case.\n\nUsually, the framework-specific SDK classes will handle this lookup for you (for example `TensorFlowModel(...)` as used in the notebook you linked, or when calling `sagemaker.tensorflow.TensorFlow.deploy(...)` from the Estimator class.\n\nI see here though that you're using the generic `Model`, so guess you don't know (or don't want to commit to) the framework and version at the point the Lambda function runs?\n\nMy suggestions would be:\n\n- Can you use the Pipelines `ModelStep` to create your model before calling the Lambda deployment function? Similarly to how your linked notebook uses `CreateModelStep`. This would build your framework & version into the pipeline definition itself, but should mean that the selection of inference container image gets handled properly & automatically.\n- If you really need to be dynamic, I think you might need to find a way of looking up at least the *framework* from the training job. From my testing, you can use `estimator = sagemaker.tensorflow.TensorFlow.attach(\"training-job-name\")` and then `model = estimator.create_model(...)` to correctly infer the specific inference container *version* from a training job, but it still relies on knowing that TensorFlow is the correct framework. I'm not aware of a framework-agnostic equivalent? So could e.g. try describing the training job, manually inferring which framework it uses from that information, and then using the relevant framework estimator class' [attach()](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/api\/training\/estimators.html#sagemaker.estimator.EstimatorBase.attach) method to figure out the specifics and create your model.",

When the text is shown to the human worker, I want the text spans that matched the RE\/model result to already be highlighted with the found entity. Then, the human can accept the result or modify it.\n\nIt looks like Ground Truth's [crowd-entity-annotation](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/sms-ui-template-crowd-entity-annotation.html)  template already provides a way to do this. The documentation says the template accepts an 'initial-value' attribute, which looks like exactly what I want. I have not been successful in using it though. \n\n\n- I tried adding an 'initial-value' array to the input manifest file of my project, but it didn't make a difference.\n\n- I found this example project using A2I that creates a custom template for displaying a model's annotations to the worker. However, when I followed this example, it only shows the model annotations in a separate textbox versus having them pre-highlighted.\n\n- I modified the custom UI template from that project to explicitly set initial-value to a task.input.initial-value field, but that also didn't work.\n\n\nThis would be a huge speed boost if I could get it to work.

        "Answer_body":"Hi there,\n\nGreetings for the day!\n\nI understand that you wanted to know how can you determine if you need more VCPU or memory when your SageMaker Notebook Instance is frozen or just taking a long time?\n\nI\u2019d like to inform you that If your Sagemaker Notebook instance is taking a long time, you can check if it is frozen or still running by monitoring the CPU and memory usage. If the CPU usage is low or zero, it may be frozen. \n\nIf the CPU usage is high but the memory usage is low, you may need more VCPUs and If the memory usage is high, you may need more memory. \n\nYou can check it via SageMaker Notebook Instance terminal:\n\nTo see the memory and CPU information in detail , kindly follow the below instructions:-\n\n[1] Start Your Notebook Instance\n[2] Go to the  Jupyter Home Page \n[3] Right hand side ,Click on DropDown Option \u201cNew\u201d \n[4] Select \u201cTerminal\u201d.\n\nIn the Jupyter terminal, Run the below commands to see the information of Memory and CPUs.\n\n[+] To see the memory information:\n\n$ free -h\n\n=> output of \u201cfree -h\u201d will provide the information of total memory, used memory, free memory, shared memory etc in human readable form.\n\n[+] To see the CPU information, you can run any of the commands:\n\n$ mpstat -u\n\n=> Output of \u201cmpstat -u\u201d consists of different fields like %guest, %gnice, %steal etc.\n\n%steal\nShow the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hyper\u2010\nvisor was servicing another virtual processor.\n\n%guest\nShow the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor.\n\n%idle\nShow the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an out\u2010\nstanding disk I\/O request.\n\nmany more.. You can find more detail about the each field of mpstat command by visiting the manual page of it. To see the manual page of mpstat command, use \u201c$ man mpstst\u201d.\n\nAlong with \u201cmpstat -u\u201d, you can also try the below listed commands to get information about the cpu:\n\n$ lscpu\n$ cat \/proc\/cpuinfo\n$ top\n\nAdditionally, You can also check the cloudwatch logs for any errors or warnings that may indicate the cause of the issue. Most of the time, Cloud watch logs helps to find out the root cause of the issue.\n\nYou can find the CloudWatch logs under CloudWatch \u2192 Log Groups \u2192 \/aws\/sagemaker\/NotebookInstances -> Notebook Instance Name\n\nBased on the analysis , you can select different Notebook Instance type, You can find more detail of SageMaker Instance Here [1].\n\nI request you to kindly follow the above suggested workarounds. \n\nIf you have any difficulty or run into any issue, Please reach out to AWS Support[+] (Sagemaker), along with your issue\/use case in details and we would be happy to assist you further.\n\n[+] Creating support cases and case management - https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/awssupport\/latest\/user\/case-management.html#creating-a-support-casehttps:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/awssupport\/latest\/user\/case-management.html#creating-a-support-case \n\nI hope this information would be useful to you.\n\nThank you!\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n[1] https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/pricing\/",

If you are developing code for ML there is a huge variety of frameworks and software that you might need to install. The DLAMI includes the more popular ones, so you may quickly deploy a machine complete with common dependencies. This results in a reduction of the time needed for installing and configuring things. It speeds up experimentation and evaluation. If you want to try a new framework, it is already there.\n\nThe second reason is that AWS keeps the AMI up to date, so you may just deploy a new AMI periodically rather than having to patch.  Again, this saves you time and lets you concentrate on the underlying development and business activities.\n\nAll that said, for running in production and at volume you might want to use a different tool, I would imagine that for most cases creating docker images to your specific requirements would make a lot of sense.

        "Question_body":"Hello! \n\nI have a Lambda function which needs to connect to a MySQL RDS instance which is within a private VPC. The Lambda function also needs to connect to a Sagemaker Serverless Inference Endpoint, taking data from the RDS instance and passing it to a Sagemaker model for inference. \n\nI have tested a vanilla Lambda function from outside of the private VPC to connect to the Sagemaker Endpoint which was successful. However, in order for Lambda to access data from the RDS database, I have associated the Lambda function with the same private VPC and subnets as the RDS instance. As a result, the Lambda function can no longer access the Sagemaker Endpoint as it now lies within the private VPC. \n\nI need advice on **how to create a VPC Interface Endpoint** to enable the Lambda function to access the Sagemaker Endpoint, and on** how to build the associated security groups** to enable the network access. I am unsure of how to implement the VPC Interface Endpoint or how to implement the correct security groups, so I would appreciate advice on the implementation. \n\nAs an alternative architecture, I could create two lambda functions: one which is associated with the private VPC and connects to the RDS instance then stores the required data in an S3 bucket; and another lambda function which is not within the VPC which pulls the data from the S3 bucket and serves it to the Sagemaker Endpoint. **Would this be a better option? **",

I've also checked that the permissions are all set up correctly.\n\nI haven't been able to find an error resembling this elsewhere. Any ideas on what might be going wrong? Thanks!\n\nEdit: I eventually 'resolved' the issue by switching from the console\/GUI to going through the CLI and setting up the job that way.

I've created SageMaker batch transformation jobs using this model using input from CSV file with multiple records, however the output file is a single record CSV containing all the inferences in a single comma separated row.  The result is that I'm not able to use the \"Join source\" feature with \"Input  - Merge input data with job output\" since the input and output files must match the number of records. I've tried with different batch job configurations but I always get the same single line output file.\n\nDo you know if is there any configuration that allows me to merge input and output in order to have a direct association between an input column with its inference result? Is this a restriction from the XGBoost algorithm built-in implementation?",

        "Answer_body":"It depends on the dataset and the question for ML to answer. \n\nYes, it is feasible to do HPO with preprocessing. However, to run a HPO job, it is required to define to a specific target to achieve, e.g. maximize\/minimize certain values during the whole HPO process. Thus, it is important to understand what is the target during preprocessing.  If the answer is yes, they should be able to leverage Hyperparameter Tuning Jobs.\n\n\n\nHere is how HPO works in SageMaker. Firstly, we define each training Job with output in a container and specify the hyperparameters in  *\/opt\/ml\/input\/config\/hyperparameters.json*. When we run the pipeline using HyperparameterTuner in SageMaker,  the initial Job can pass the hyperparameters to the Pipeline for HPO, and return the model with *highest score*.\n\nOption 1, if there is a clear defined target for preprocessing to achieve,  we can also do HPO separately for data preprocessing through defining the function and outputs in a container and use HyperparameterTuner fit to tune the preprocessing.  \n\nOption 2.   include the preprocessing + training code in the whole SageMaker Training Job. But then you can't use separate infrastructure for training and preprocessing.\n\nSo it depends on what exactly they are looking for, but they can likely use SageMaker HPO.",

        "Question_body":"I have this case where I try to make a batch transform on a very sizable npy file. The file contains a 3D array (3000, 100, 100) where each observation is one element along the first axis and has the dim (1, 100, 100) for a total of 3000 observations.\n\nNow I worked with batch transform in the past and for .csv or .jsonlines files it is a relatively easy way with split_type='Line' in the transform method. However, when I try to pass the big npy file, it does not seem to work with split_type='Line'. It works without it on smaller files, and the batch transform is successful. The image I am using is a pytorch cpu one, and the code that works for smaller files is:\n```\npredictor = Transformer(model_name='testingdep3',\n                        instance_count= 1,\n                        instance_type= 'ml.m5.large',\n                        strategy= \"SingleRecord\",\n                        output_path= 's3:\/\/xxx\/inferencetesting\/output\/',\n                        accept= \"application\/x-npy\")\n```\n\n```\npredictor.transform(data='s3:\/\/xxx\/inferencetesting\/testdata111.npy',\n                    content_type='application\/x-npy',\n                    # split_type='Line'\n                   )\n```\n\nMy input_fn and predict_fn functions are as follows:\n\n```\ndef input_fn(request_body, content_type='application\/x-npy'):\n    return np.load(io.BytesIO(request_body), allow_pickle=True)\n```\n\n```\ndef predict_fn(input_object, model):\n    predictions = model.predict(input_object)\n    return predictions\n```\n\nThe maximum acceptable payload is MaxPayloadInMB=6 for this specific image. I was thinking of different ways of approaching this problem, including:\n\n- having multiple smaller .npy files in the data directory\n- changing the npy file to a protobuf format and then changing my input_fn to account for that, as well as uncommenting the split_line argument with the RecordIO value\n\nIs there really no way to actually feed a very big numpy file to a batch transform job so that it's split somehow by using the standard arguments split_type and\/or strategy?",

        "Question_body":"I am trying to set up a Random Cut Forest model with a Data Quality job attached.\nI managed to train and deploy the model with the \"data_capture\" feature enabled.\n\n``` python\n# Training\nrcf = sagemaker.RandomCutForest(\n    role=role,\n    instance_count=1,\n    instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',\n    data_location=f\"s3:\/\/{BUCKET}\/random_cut_forest\/input\",\n    output_path=f's3:\/\/{BUCKET}\/random_cut_forest\/output',\n    num_sample_per_tree=1024,\n    num_trees=50,\n    serializer=JSONSerializer(),\n    deserializer=CSVDeserializer()\n)\nrs = rcf.record_set(df_multi_measurements.drop(\"datetime\", axis=1).to_numpy())\nrcf.fit(rs, wait=False)\n```\n\n``` python\n# Deploy\ndata_capture_config = DataCaptureConfig(\n    enable_capture=True, \n    sampling_percentage=100, \n    destination_s3_uri=s3_capture_upload_path\n)\nrcf_inference = rcf.deploy(\n    initial_instance_count=1, \n    instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',\n    endpoint_name=ENDPOINT_NAME,\n    data_capture_config=data_capture_config,\n    serializer=CSVSerializer(),\n    deserializer=JSONDeserializer(),\n    )\n```\nThen, I configured and started the ModelMonitor job\n\n``` python\n# Model Monitor\nmy_default_monitor = DefaultModelMonitor(\n    role=role,\n    instance_count=1,\n    instance_type=\"ml.m4.xlarge\",\n    volume_size_in_gb=5,\n    max_runtime_in_seconds=3600\n)\n\nmy_default_monitor.suggest_baseline(\n    baseline_dataset=baseline_data_uri + \"\/df_multi_measurements.csv\",\n    dataset_format=DatasetFormat.csv(header=True),\n    output_s3_uri=baseline_results_uri,\n    wait=True,\n    logs=False\n)\n\nmy_default_monitor.create_monitoring_schedule(\n    monitor_schedule_name=mon_schedule_name,\n    endpoint_input=rcf_inference.endpoint,\n    output_s3_uri=s3_report_path,\n    statistics=my_default_monitor.baseline_statistics(),\n    constraints=my_default_monitor.suggested_constraints(),\n    schedule_cron_expression=CronExpressionGenerator.hourly(),\n    enable_cloudwatch_metrics=True,\n)\n```\n\nBut at the first run of the job I got this error:\n\n> Error: Encoding mismatch: Encoding is CSV for endpointInput, but Encoding is JSON for endpointOutput. We currently only support the same type of input and output encoding at the moment.\n\nData captured looked like: \n```\n{\"captureData\":{\"endpointInput\":{\"observedContentType\":\"text\/csv\",\"mode\":\"INPUT\",\"data\":\"4.150000013333333,3.330000003333333,...\",\"encoding\":\"CSV\"},\"endpointOutput\":{\"observedContentType\":\"application\/json\",\"mode\":\"OUTPUT\",\"data\":\"{\\\"scores\\\":[{\\\"score\\\":0.5794829282}]}\",\"encoding\":\"JSON\"}},\"eventMetadata\":{\"eventId\":\"79add993-68cf-4903-9dfe-8275d164496f\",\"inferenceTime\":\"2023-03-17T14:10:08Z\"},\"eventVersion\":\"0\"}\n...\n```\n\nSo later I tried to force input and output to be both CSV but no luck.\n\nAfter some tuning, I managed to instruct DataCapture to only collect requests in JSON so, since I couldn't change the output, now DataCapture has both input and output in the same (JSON) form. \n\nThe JSON requests look like this:\n``` json\n{\n    \"instances\": [\n        {\n            'features': [3.8600000533333336, 3.5966666533333336...]\n        }, \n        ...\n    ]\n}\n```\nand the model correctly works, returning its predictions: \n```\nb'{\"scores\":[{\"score\":0.6015237349},...]}'\n```\n\nData captured now looks like: \n```\n{\"captureData\":{\"endpointInput\":{\"observedContentType\":\"application\/json\",\"mode\":\"INPUT\",\"data\":\"{\\\"instances\\\": [{\\\"features\\\": [3.8600000533333336, 3.5966666533333336, ...]}]}\",\"encoding\":\"JSON\"},\"endpointOutput\":{\"observedContentType\":\"application\/json\",\"mode\":\"OUTPUT\",\"data\":\"{\\\"scores\\\":[{\\\"score\\\":0.6015237349},{\\\"score\\\":0.4439660733},{\\\"score\\\":0.5100689867},{\\\"score\\\":0.5456048291},{\\\"score\\\":0.5099260466}]}\",\"encoding\":\"JSON\"}},\"eventMetadata\":{\"eventId\":\"27e2c9cd-3301-419c-8d06-9ede4c6380e6\",\"inferenceTime\":\"2023-03-17T17:10:18Z\"},\"eventVersion\":\"0\"}\n```\n\nBUT... at the first run of this new configuration, the job returns an error on the data analysis part.\n\nSo, after some search, I found that model monitor only works with tabular data or plain json, so I added a preprocessing step into the ModelMonitor\nhttps:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/model-monitor-pre-and-post-processing.html\n\nThe preprocessing script looks like this:\n\n```\nimport json\nimport random\n\n\"\"\"\n{\n    \"instances\": [\n        {\n            'features': [3.8600000533333336, 3.5966666533333336...]\n        }\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\ndef preprocess_handler(inference_record):\n    input_record = inference_record.endpoint_input.data\n    print(input_record)\n    input_record_dict = json.loads(input_record)\n    \n    features = input_record_dict[\"instances\"][0]['features']\n    \n    return { str(i).zfill(20) : d for i, d in enumerate(features) }\n\n```\n\nAnd now, at the first run, again, I get an error that this time is absolutely NOT understandable at all:\n```\n2023-03-17 18:08:46,326 ERROR Main: No usable value for features\n2023-03-17T19:08:46.935+01:00\tNo usable value for completeness\n2023-03-17T19:08:46.935+01:00\tDid not find value which can be converted into double\n```\n\nAt this stage I feel a bit stuck. \nHow can this be fixed? RCF and ModelMonitor should be easier to be integrated in my opinion.\n\nWhat I am doing wrong?",

        "Question_body":"Had no problem deploying sample models to DeepLens, but really struggling to get a SageMaker trained model to deploy successfully.  Here is what I have done so far:  \n  \n- Extracted images from video with AWS MediaConnect  \n- Cropped images to 540x540 with PIL and stored in S3  \n- Ran labeling job with Mechanical Turk to draw bounding box around object  \n- Ran training job in SageMaker console using Object Detection algorithm and input size 540  \n- Created model in SageMaker console from training job  \n- Imported model into DeepLens console  \n- Copied and modified Object Detection lambda with call to mo.optimize('model_algo_1',540,540)  \n- Created and deployed project to two separate DeepLens cameras  \n  \nNot getting an output stream on either DeepLens.  One device is about a year old.  I have run all the software updates and mo.optimize steps recommended in the troubleshooting guide.  The other device is brand new out of the box, updated to latest version via DeepLens console.  I have not monkeyed with the new device, so all further information will pertain to the older device.  I have connected a monitor and keyboard to the older device and am working in a terminal window.  \n  \nWhen I ran mo.optimize in terminal, I got a warning about having MXNET version 1.4.0 and 1.0.0 being required, along with list range errors.  I rolled back MXNET to 1.0.0 per the troubleshooting guide.  I did this with both PIP and PIP3.    \n  \nWhen I import mo in Python3, I get an import error message saying \"no module named mo\".   \n  \nWhen I import mo and run mo.optimize in Python, I get an access error about the current user lacking write permission to opt\/aws\/artifacts.

        "Question_body":"Hi all!\nSo, we're trying to implement a very simple Sagemaker Pipeline with 3 steps:\n* **ETL:** for now it only runs a simple query\n* **Batch transform:** uses the ETL's result and generates predictions with a batch transform job\n* **Report:** generates an HTML report\n\nThe thing is, when running the batch transform job alone in the Pipeline, everything runs OK. But when trying to run all the steps in a Pipeline, the batch transform job fails, and what we have seen in the logs is that the job takes the dataset which was generated in the ETL step, generates the predictions and saves them correctly in S3 (this is where we would expect the job to stop) but then it resends those predictions to the endpoint, as if they were a new input, and so the step fails as the model receives an array of 1 column thus mismatching the number of features which it was trained with.\n\nThere's not much info out there on this, and Sagemaker is painfully hard to debug. Has anyone experienced anything like this?\n\nOur model and transformer code:\n\n```python\nmodel = XGBoostModel(\n    model_data=f\"s3:\/\/{BUCKET}\/{MODEL_ARTIFACTS_PATH}\/artifacts.gzip\",\n    role=get_execution_role(),\n    entry_point=\"predict.py\",\n    framework_version=\"1.3-1\",\n)\n\ntransformer = model.transformer(\n    instance_count=1,\n    instance_type=\"ml.m5.large\",\n    output_path=f\"s3:\/\/{BUCKET}\/{PREDICTIONS_PATH}\/\",\n    accept=\"text\/csv\",\n)\n\nstep = TransformStep(\n    name=\"Batch\",\n    transformer=transformer,\n    inputs=TransformInput(\n        data=etl_step.properties.ProcessingOutputConfig.Outputs[\n            \"dataset\"\n        ].S3Output.S3Uri,\n        content_type=\"text\/csv\",\n        split_type=\"Line\",\n    ),\n    depends_on=[etl_step],\n)\n```\n\nAnd our inference script:\n\n```python\ndef input_fn(request_body, content_type):\n    return pd.read_csv(StringIO(request_body), header=None).values\n\n\ndef predict_fn(input_obj, model):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function which takes the result of input_fn and generates\n    predictions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return model.predict_proba(input_obj)[:, 1]\n\n\ndef output_fn(predictions, content_type):\n    return \",\".join(str(pred) for pred in predictions)\n```",

Can I create something like this:\n* `Variant1` with `XGBoost` serving `XGBoost_model_1` having a weight of `0.5`\n* `Variant2` with a Multi-container having both `XGBoost` and `KMeans` (with a `MultiModel` setup) having a weight of `0.5`\n\nSo that the client could:\n* call `invoke_endpoint(TargetVariant=\"Variant2\", TargetContainer=\"KMeans\", TargetModel=\"KMeans_model_1\")` to access the `KMeans_model_1`\n* call `invoke_endpoint(TargetVariant=\"Variant2\", TargetContainer=\"KMeans\", TargetModel=\"KMeans_model_2\")` to access the `KMeans_model_2`\n* call `invoke_endpoint(TargetVariant=\"Variant1\")` to access the `XGBoost_model_1`\n* call `invoke_endpoint(TargetVariant=\"Variant2\", TargetContainer=\"XGBoost\")` to access the `XGBoost_model_1`\n\nIs that combination even possible? \n\nIf so, what happens when the client calls the `invoke_endpoint` without specifying the variant? For example:\n* would `invoke_endpoint(TargetContainer=\"KMeans\", TargetModel=\"KMeans_model_2\")` fail 50% of the time (if it hits the right variant then it works just fine, if it hits the wrong one it would most likely result with a 400\/500 error (\"incorrect payload\")?",

        "Question_body":"I have an ML workload that involves providing predictions for large datasets on demand. The model is a PyTorch text classifier and the workload involves pricing predictions for 10's of thousands of records. The jobs arrive randomly but are very infrequent.\n\nI've created a standard Sagemaker endpoint and performance is acceptable when I do client batching, i.e. \n\n\n```\noutputs = []\nfor batch in create_minibatch(inputs, batch_size=128):\n    predictions = predictor.predict(batch)\n    outputs.extend(predictions)\n```\n\n\nThis takes around a minute for 25k records using a single instance.\n\nI've considered using the AWS Batch mode, but it takes around 4-6 minutes to create the job, so any benefit from the ability to scale up to multiple instances seems to be lost due to the start-up cost. Is it possible to use Sagemaker Batch processing with a persistent endpoint? \n\nThe alternative is to use client batching (using the code above) - but if I create multiple instances can I be sure that each batch is returned in the order I request?

        "Answer_body":"Hi,\n\nPlease find my answers below.\n\n**Question:** Is it possible to use Sagemaker Batch processing with a persistent endpoint?\n\n**Answer:** Currently SageMaker does not have such option.\n\n**Question:** The alternative is to use client batching (using the code above) - but if I create multiple instances can I be sure that each batch is returned in the order I request? In the example above I need to zip the inputs and outputs.\n\n**Answer**: When you send each batch to your endpoint, the request is synchronous, and your application will be waiting to get a response right away. The response will be in the order you sent. So maintaining the order is a matter of how you manage your requests. Regardless of how many instances you use in the endpoint.\n\n\n**Question:** Is there a better way of serving this workload - I feel it falls somewhere in between the API and Batch paradigm?\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThere is two main issues at play here:\n1. Cost\n2. Time\n\nDepending on your business need and which of the above is more important for you, or if you need to find a balance between the two.\n\nSageMaker has the following inference options that might be useful for your case:\n1. [Real-time inference](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/realtime-endpoints.html): here you provision resources for the endpoint and it stays up and running, so when you need to do predictions you use it straight away with no wait. Cost is based time the endpoint was `InService` and number and type of instance (see [pricing page](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/pricing\/)).\n2. [Batch Inference](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/batch-transform.html): Here you send large number of records that you want to get predictions for. It requires resources to be provisioned first, which can take few minutes before actual prediction happens. Cost will be calculated based on the time it took to do predictions.\n\nTheoretically speaking, time took to do predictions in 1 or 2 should be very similar. However in 1, you provision the endpoint in advance, so when you invoke it, it feels faster, because your instance been there and ready. And comes with extra cost.\n\nNow if this option is good for you, you can always provision the endpoint in advance before you start predictions, and tear it down after. This way you get the benefit from both worlds. \n\nHowever, there is currently no option where the resource are persistent and you can just start predicting when you want. Just because of cost and operational considerations are in play here.",

Given that, if I run it normally, everything works properly, when I try to add *MaxWaitTimeInSeconds* , *MaxRuntimeInSeconds* , and *use_spot_instances* I get the following error:\n\n`ClientError: An error occurred (ValidationException) when calling the CreateTrainingJob operation: Invalid MaxWaitTimeInSeconds. It must be present and be greater than or equal to MaxRuntimeInSeconds`\n\nThis happens independently from the value I assign to them, I tried every combination, including MaxWaitTimeInSeconds greater than or equal to MaxRuntimeInSeconds.

If you get the default values defined there you can re-create the URL and download the .zip file as well:\nhttps:\/\/sagemaker-servicecatalog-seedcode-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com\/toolchain\/model-building-workflow-jenkins-v1.0.zip\n\nSo, in the end, if you want to change the content that is pushed to the git repo, you can redefine these 2 vars and point to an S3 path that contains a .zip file you created.\n\nBonus: If you're a curious person, I recommend you to take a look at the .java file (src\/main\/java\/GitRepositorySeedCodeBootStrapper.java) inside the .zip of the CodeBuild .zip for you to understand what it does to prepare the git repo like: download a .zip, unpack it, commit\/push to the git repo.",

Please check CloudWatch logs for this endpoint.\"  \n  \nIn the log I found the following block repeating over and over again until some time later the creating Endpoint process just stopped and the status turned 'failed' in the SageMaker UI:\n\n```\nError: A JNI error has occurred, please check your installation and try again\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org\/eclipse\/jetty\/util\/thread\/ThreadPool\r\n#011at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredMethods0(Native Method)\r\n#011at java.lang.Class.privateGetDeclaredMethods(Class.java:2701)\r\n#011at java.lang.Class.privateGetMethodRecursive(Class.java:3048)\r\n#011at java.lang.Class.getMethod0(Class.java:3018)\r\n#011at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:1784)\r\n#011at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.validateMainClass(LauncherHelper.java:544)\r\n#011at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(LauncherHelper.java:526)\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.ThreadPool\r\n#011at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:382)\r\n#011at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)\r\n#011at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:349)\r\n#011at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)\r\n#011... 7 more\r\nGot sigterm signal, exiting.\n```\n\nI coded in Python in Databricks and as far as I could tell this is a Java error so I have no idea what went wrong, anyone has any experience deploying an 'outside' model to SageMaker?  Any help or tips would be much appreciated!  \n  \nFYI: my whole s3 setup, ECR setup were in us-west-2(Oregon); the integration of AWS IAM role and Databricks Role are properly set up; in my s3,  I could see the Databricks distributed filesystem in one bucket and the trained and pickled model in another; the docker image that is supposed to hold the model is successfully registered in ECR. I also tried to change the instance type under 'Production variants' in the Endpoint creation settings, I set it to the same instance type (ml.m5.large) as the one I used to initiate the Databricks runtime cluster but it did not seem to work.  \n  \nUpdate: I successfully trained, logged and deployed a sklearn model, but still have the same issue with spark ML model; for the container, I used a image built by mlflow:\n\n ```\n mlflow sagemaker build-and-push-container\n ```\n\nEdited by: ShumZZ on Sep 29, 2019 3:12 PM  \n  \nEdited by: ShumZZ on Oct 2, 2019 2:42 PM",

        "Answer_body":"If you specify a checkpoint configuration (***regardless of managed spot training***) when starting a training job, checkpointing will work. You can provide a local path and S3 path as follows (API reference):\n\n    \"CheckpointConfig\": { \n      \"LocalPath\": \"string\",\n      \"S3Uri\": \"string\"\n    }\n\nThe local path defaults to `\/opt\/ml\/checkpoints\/`, and then you specify the target path in S3 with `S3Uri`.\n\n***Given this configuration, SageMaker will configure an output channel with Continuous upload mode to Amazon S3***. At the time being, this results in running an agent on the hosts that watches the file system and continuously uploads data to Amazon S3. Similar behavior is applied when debugging is enabled, for delivering tensor data to Amazon S3.\n\nAs commented, `sagemaker-containers` implements its own code to save intermediate outputs and watching files on the file system, but I would rather rely on the functionality offered by the service to avoid dependencies on specific libraries where possible.\n\n**Note**: when using SageMaker Processing, which in my view can be considered an abstraction over training or, from another perspective, the foundation for training, you can configure an output channel to use continuous upload mode; further info [here][1].\n\n\n  [1]: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_ProcessingS3Output.html",

Or does this mean that the first two months you're using Sagemaker, up to 250 hours per month of t2.medium notebook usage is free?  \n  \nI really just want to test something but I have to know if I can still do this for free. I've had my account since september 2018 so >2 months.   \n  \nThe FAQ page that's referred to about expiring offers FREE TRIAL (What's the difference between expiring and non-expiring offers?

        "Question_body":"I am running into an issue where a SageMaker training job will successfully complete the training script but will fail during the model upload stage after training. The specific error given in the SageMaker portal is the following:\n\nClientError: Please use an instance type with more memory, or reduce the size of training data processed on an instance.\n\nI upgraded the instance used for training but this did not resolve the issue. Furthermore, the issue seems to occur randomly for different training jobs where the only difference is the dataset. All other characteristics are the same. It is strange to me why this should affect the model upload stage while the training job itself is successful. Note that I do not store the training data in the model output directory. The CloudWatch log reports successful completion of the training job:\n\n2023-06-14 07:50:10,625 sagemaker-training-toolkit INFO Reporting training SUCCESS\n\nAnd the job status overview in the SageMaker portal shows where the issue arises:\n\nStatus History\nStarting\t       6\/11\/2023, 8:12:33 PM\t6\/11\/2023, 8:13:47 PM\tPreparing the instances for training\nDownloading\t6\/11\/2023, 8:13:47 PM\t6\/11\/2023, 8:15:26 PM\tDownloading input data\nTraining\t        6\/11\/2023, 8:15:26 PM       6\/14\/2023, 1:51:15 AM\tTraining image download completed.

        "Answer_body":"Hi,\n\n1. In general, AWS Marketplace uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which means that customers are charged for the resources they consume on an hourly or per-inference basis. I'm not aware of any way to disable this pricing model when selling a model package on AWS Marketplace. However, it's worth noting that AWS Marketplace also offers private listings, which allow you to sell your model package directly to a specific customer or group of customers. Private offers are not discoverable by other customers and are not subject to the same pricing and billing terms as public listings. You may want to consider using a private listing if you want to offer a different pricing model for your model package. Reference: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/marketplace\/latest\/buyerguide\/buyer-private-offers.html\n\n2. Yes, it is possible to define an auto scaling policy for a hosted Amazon SageMaker endpoint that runs a model package. To define an auto scaling policy for a SageMaker endpoint, you can use the *UpdateEndpoint* API or the SageMaker console. When updating an endpoint, you can specify the desired number of instances and the minimum and maximum number of instances for the auto scaling policy. SageMaker will automatically scale the number of instances up or down based on the incoming traffic and the defined policy.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the *UpdateEndpoint* API to update an endpoint with an auto scaling policy:\n\n```\nimport boto3\n\nsm = boto3.client('sagemaker')\n\nresponse = sm.update_endpoint(\n    EndpointName='your-endpoint-name',\n    DesiredInferenceUnits=1,\n    MinInferenceUnits=1,\n    MaxInferenceUnits=8\n)\n\n```\nMore details: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_UpdateEndpoint.html\n\n3. To make an inference call to a hosted Amazon SageMaker endpoint, you can use the *invoke_endpoint* method of the SageMaker runtime client. This method allows you to send an HTTP POST request to the endpoint and receive the prediction results in the response.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the *invoke_endpoint* method to make an inference request:\n\n```\nimport boto3\n\nsm = boto3.client('sagemaker-runtime')\n\nresponse = sm.invoke_endpoint(\n    EndpointName='your-endpoint-name',\n    Body=b'your-request-data',\n    ContentType='application\/json'\n)\nprediction = response['Body'].read()\n\n```\nYou can pass any parameters that your model expects in the request body. The format of the request data and the expected parameters depend on the specific model that you are using. For example, if your model expects a JSON object with a single field called \"input\", you can pass the input data as a JSON string in the request body.\n\nMore details: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_runtime_InvokeEndpoint.html\n\n4. Yes, you can use S3 to store additional dependencies for your ML model and load them into Amazon SageMaker. SageMaker allows you to specify additional code and libraries to be included in your training or inference environment by using the CodeRepository parameter of the CreateTrainingJob or CreateEndpoint API. The CodeRepository parameter should be set to the Amazon S3 URI of a Git repository that contains the code and dependencies you want to include. SageMaker will clone the repository and build the code as part of the training or inference environment.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the CodeRepository parameter to specify an S3-based Git repository in a CreateTrainingJob request:\n\n```\nimport boto3\n\nsm = boto3.client('sagemaker')\n\nresponse = sm.create_training_job(\n    TrainingJobName='your-training-job-name',\n    HyperParameters={...},\n    InputDataConfig=[{...}],\n    OutputDataConfig={...},\n    ResourceConfig={...},\n    RoleArn='your-role-arn',\n    CodeRepository='s3:\/\/your-bucket\/your-repository.git'\n)\n\n```\nMore details: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_CreateTrainingJob.html",

I've been using JSONLint to verify the JSON structure of my document, and the initial manifest does not meet the criteria.

I've attempted creating a list for the objects to reside in, as well as a top level object called 'Sources' to hold all of the other objects. Neither solution has worked so far. I have done some more research  after some extensive testing.\n\nIt seems that there may be something wrong with my pre-processing lambda. Currently when investigating cloudwatch, I am showing my poppler layer as having read and execute access; but not write access.\n\nThis makes sense, as the poppler layer is responsible for PDFPlumber which is responsible for interacting with the actual pdf page. If the Poppler layer doesn't have write access, it would make sense that the label jobs would be submitted without any content. \n\nMy challenge now is to figure out how to change these permissions. In addition to this, I've found that my JSON file is being 'read' when I submit an API-Call to Sagemaker for a labeling job. It seems as if that when I submit a job through the console, the initial JSON Parse always fails. I've tested this with other JSON files formatted in several different ways (according to JSON Lines and AWS examples) and they never seem to work.\n\nI am unsure if this is a bug or if there is something wrong with my setup, but it seems to function as intended when submitted through the CLI as an API-Request.",

I would like to have access to Tensorboard for metrics visualization. Do you have code examples to do that? Thanks! Hello Lorenzo,\nYes, you can follow the document below to set up the Tensorboard. Please note this will create an app in your domain so cost will occur. \n\n\"Amazon SageMaker with TensorBoard runs the TensorBoard application on an ml.r5.large instance and incurs charges after the SageMaker free tier or the free trial period of the feature. For more information, see Amazon SageMaker Pricing.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/tensorboard-on-sagemaker.html Thanks Jann. The problem seems to be that the Jumpstart models (e.g. in s3:\/\/jumpstart-cache-prod-us-east-1\/source-directory-tarballs\/tensorflow\/transfer_learning\/od1\/v1.1.0\/sourcedir.tar.gz) don't know how to open those annotation files it seems. I'm seeing the error: \n```train_data, validation_data, num_classes, class_to_idx = load_data( File \"\/opt\/ml\/code\/dataset.py\", line 196, in load_data aggregate_annotations_per_file_process_and_save(root=train_data_dir) File \"\/opt\/ml\/code\/dataset.py\", line 31, in aggregate_annotations_per_file_process_and_save with open(os.path.join(root, constants.ANNOTATION_FILE)) as f:\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '\/opt\/ml\/input\/data\/training\/annotations.json'\n```\nThe jumpstart code is still looking for the annotation.json file, and it probably wants to use that to load the annotations In general, would the models in Jumpstart be able to load the images and annotations listed in the augmented manifest file produced by GroundTruth? Unfortunately, it is not supported for Jumpstart models as they are expecting a different type of format. You may need to, which you probably have done, write a custom script to convert the format.",

Augmented manifests can only support Pipe input mode.\n\nSo the specific example you asked [here](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/object-detection-tensorflow.html) is not going to work using augmented manifest, because it's script mode.

        "Question_body":"I have an ML model from Huggingface, which essentially looks as follows:\n\n```\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import BloomTokenizerFast, BloomForCausalLM\n\ndevice = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\ndevice\n\ntokenizer = BloomTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(\"bigscience\/bloom-560m\")\nmodel = BloomForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"bigscience\/bloom-560m\").to(device)\n\ntext = tokenizer.encode(seed)\ninputs, past_key_values = torch.tensor([text[0]]), None\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    while #condition met:\n        model_out = model(input_ids=inputs.to(device), past_key_values=past_key_values)\n        ...\n        # Generate new inputs and go back to the start\n```\n\nNow I would like to deploy this model to Inf1 on AWS Sagemaker see [here](https:\/\/sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/sagemaker_neo_compilation_jobs\/deploy_pytorch_model_on_Inf1_instance\/pytorch_torchvision_neo_on_Inf1.html#Deploying-pre-trained-PyTorch-vision-models-with-Amazon-SageMaker-Neo-On-Inf1-Instance):\n\n```\nfrom sagemaker.pytorch.model import PyTorchModel\n\npytorch_model = PyTorchModel(\n    model_data=model_path,\n    role=role,\n    entry_point=\"my_entry_point_file.py\",\n    framework_version=\"1.5.1\",\n    py_version=\"py3\",\n)\n\nneo_model = pytorch_model.compile(\n    target_instance_family=\"ml_inf1\",\n    input_shape={\"input0\": [1, 3, 224, 224]},\n    output_path=compiled_model_path,\n    framework=\"pytorch\",\n    framework_version=\"1.5.1\",\n    role=role,\n    job_name=compilation_job_name,\n)\n```\n\nHowever, in my case I get \n\n```\nUnexpectedStatusException: Error for Compilation job bloom-compiled-inf-inf1-202304-1921-4203: Failed.

For further troubleshooting common failures please visit: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/neo-troubleshooting-compilation.html\n```\n\nI believe the main problem is the following: Whereas `inputs` can be considered of length `[1,1]`, the variable `past_key_values` is much more complex. In this case, it is \n\n- a tuple of length 24\n- each entry is a tuple itself of length 2\n- the two entries are torch tensors of size `[16, 64, 6]` and `[16, 6, 64]`\n\nMy question is now, what can I do such that it works on Inf1?\n\nI could imagine that either \n\n- there is a way to enter the right `input_shape`, which can be something like `{\u2018var1\u2019: [1,1,28,28], \u2018var2\u2019:[1,1,28,28]}` (I do not know how to display the more complex tuple-tensor structure as outlined above)\n- or can we split `past_key_values` such that we can build `input_shape` easily?\n\nAny suggestions would be very appreciated.",

        "Question_body":"Hi There, \nI'm in trouble with autoscaling related to Sagemaker Async Endpoint. In Particular, I have 3 cloudwatch alarms that trigger the scaling policy: \n- ApproximateBacklogSizePerInstance < 4.5 for 15 datapoints within 15 minutes\n- ApproximateBacklogSizePerInstance > 5 for 3 datapoints within 3 minutes\n- HasBacklogWithoutCapacity >= 1 for 1 datapoints within 1 minute\n\nWhen the scaling out happens, my endpoint remains stucked in updating status until all the processing of enqueued messages is over. This implies in some errors like:\n- *The primary container for production variant AllTraffic did not pass the ping health check. Please check CloudWatch log for this endpoint.* -> Because of this error, several instances are created and destroyed (I checked in cloudTrail history actions). This results in some messages being \"stranded\" during processing, which unfortunately is not completed anymore. This only resumes when another scaling IN action is performed. (If, for example, I have 50 messages to process, my endpoint will reach the configured maximum number of instances and produce the above error. Than, it will not process some messages. Processing of these will only resume when a scaling IN is performed).\n\n- *Received error: \"Resource endpoint\/endpoint_name\/variant\/AllTraffic was not in a scalable state due to reason: Endpoint X is in Updating state, should be in InService state to scale.\"*;\n\nMoreover, when the scaling in to 0 instances is performed and there are some messages that are being processed (in a number less than our threshold), some of them remains \"stranded\" (similar to the first point) and are no longer processed (no errors are produced). Only when another scale activity is performed, these messages becomes again \"visible\" and so processed (it is as if there was a visibility timeout for the queue inside the Sagemaker Endpoint).\n\nHow could I solve these problems?? Seems to be a bug.\n\nThe python code I'm using to create the Endpoint is the following:\n\n```\nmodel = TensorFlowModel(\n    source_dir=f'..\/models\/{model_name}\/code',\n    entry_point='inference.py',\n    sagemaker_session=session,\n    model_data=model_data_tar_gz, \n    role=tf_model_role, \n    image_uri=image_uri,\n    name=model_sg_name,\n    code_location=final_model_output,\n    env={\n        \n        'OMP_NUM_THREADS': '1',\n        'SAGEMAKER_TFS_INTRA_OP_PARALLELISM': '1', # Setting this environment variable to the number of available physical cores is recommended.

This model image is deployed as async inference endpoint. Everything works well, the endpoint can be invoked via InvokeEndpointAsync, custom attributes are provided to the model code via \"X-Amzn-SageMaker-Custom-Attributes\" header, the input located on S3 is provided as http body. After succesful processing the result is uploaded to S3 with an automatically generated output filename (\"*.out\").\nThe container behavior is logged to CloudWatch via Python logging module, initialized as:\n\n```\nimport logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\n```\nHowever, the request arriving inside the container neither contains an \"X-Amzn-SageMaker-Inference-Id\" nor \"X-Amzn-SageMaker-InputLocation\" field (mentioned here https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_runtime_InvokeEndpointAsync.html). Is there a way to access the inference_id\/output filename from inside the container? Or any other opportunity to link input filename\/container log\/output filename?

        "Question_body":"Hi fellow AWS users,\n\nI am working on an inference pipeline on AWS.\nSimply put, I have trained a PyTorch model and I deployed it (and created an inference endpoint) on Sagemaker from a notebook.\n\nOn the other hand, I have a lambda that will be triggered whenever there is a new audio that gets uploaded to my S3 bucket and pass the name of that audio to the endpoint. The endpoint downloads the audio, performs some pre-processing (super-quick) and returns predictions. The lambda then sends these predictions by email.\n\nAudios get uploaded on the S3 bucket on a non regular basis, like around 10 audios a day, at irregular intervals.\n\nThis morning, I tried manually uploading a test audio to the bucket to check if the pipeline was working.\nIt turns out that my endpoint is correctly invoked by my lambda but looking at the endpoint logs nothing happens (and I don't get any email). I tried a couple of times, without any more success. The lambda just ends up timing out after 300ms (what I set).\nHowever, invoking the endpoint from my sagemaker notebook worked perfectly fine on the first try and seemed to unblock the endpoint. After that, the endpoint was responsive to the lambda invokation.\nWas that because the endpoint was not \"cold\" anymore and it was a coincidence, I couldn't tell.\n\nMy questions are: \n- Are there any differences in endpoint invokations between the two scenarios (from the lambda or from the Sagemaker notebook)?\n- How can we see how much time after an invokation the endpoint will become \"cold\" again? Please correct me If I am wrong using the term cold here. I know it applies to lambdas as well. To what I understood, the endpoint is basically calling my inference script on a ECR container. \n- According to my use case (number of inferences a day, pre-proccesing lightness, ...), what would be the best option for my endpoint? (async, batch, ...)\n- My lambda seems to try invokation twice in total (invoke 1 - timeout 1 - invoke 2 - timeout 2). Can that be set differently? \n- Shall I increase the timeout of my lambda and let it try more times until the ECR is \"warm\"? or is there such a setting that can be modified on the endpoint side?\n\nThank you so much in advance for your support.\n\nCheers\n\nAntoine",

I put myself and a co-worker as annotators just so I can verify that I can set up the task properly and I only uploaded 37 pdf's. However when both of us log in and start the task, the webpage loads as the instructions tell us to however there is no pdf rendered (though I think I see it briefly flash on the screen before it goes blank) and there are also no entities to be selected as a part of the ui unlike how the documentation pictures the tool. I am trying to do named entity recognition and created this task with the full 25 entities I want to be able to label and Also another time with only 5 entities to label.

I have the custom labeling task template and pre-\/post-labeling Lambda functions set up and I figured I could pass in the labels through the manifest file.  \n  \nMy issue is that the Ground Truth job ignores the attributes in the manifest file that are not \"source-ref\" (or \"source\"). This causes the pre-processing Lambda function to fail because the request it is passed only contains the \"source-ref\" attribute, but the Lambda function also references a different attribute. Are augmented manifest files supported for Ground Truth and if they are, how can I make use of the extra attributes?  \n  \nReferences:  \nGround Truth Input Data: <https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/sms-data-input.html>  \nSageMaker Augmented Manifest Files: <https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/augmented-manifest.html>  \n  \nExample:  \n  \nA normal Ground Truth manifest file:\n\n```\n{\"source-ref\":\"s3:\/\/some_bucket\/images\/img1.png\"}\r\n{\"source-ref\":\"s3:\/\/some_bucket\/images\/img2.png\"}\r\n...\n```\n\nWhat I want to be able to use:\n\n```\n{\"source-ref\":\"s3:\/\/some_bucket\/images\/img1.png\",\"labels\":[\"pen\",\"pencil\",\"stick\"]}\r\n{\"source-ref\":\"s3:\/\/some_bucket\/images\/img2.png\",\"labels\":[\"tv\",\"laptop\",\"phone\"]}\r\n...\n```\n\n",

        "Question_body":"## Issue 1\nIn AWS SageMaker studio, I ran a pipeline and checked on its status in Pipelines -> cltv-long-term-predict. It seemingly finished successfully:\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMHC6R6r7SROq_raplrKQlQQ)\n\nHowever, when I click on it, click on the step -> Logs, I see that it failed (library was not installed, I should've commented the import). \n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMthkH4g8tQHakDNnMCEolVA)\n\nWhat bothers me is that this failure is not reported in the first pic, so it's more difficult to detect such occurrences and makes debugging longer\/clumsier. When I look at the same process 10 days later in SageMaker studio, I can no longer see the Logs. Are they deleted after some time? \n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IM-9ahVOopQRWMJzrAr_QuGA)\n\nI went to SageMaker -> on the left panel -> Processing -> Processing Jobs and again, I see the process as completed:\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMDQNTQMhbSiukx9d0SD2NBQ)\n\nIt was difficult to even find my specific execution, as the name is quite different than the one in Studio Pipelines, but I think it is the same. As you can see, it is marked as finished successfully. If I open it:\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMNDfzIho5TvCezJBDuN1ZqA)\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IM8nU5sNBQRU-0hzNVR6B4xw)\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMVfMo83nQSNGYtBQ7JVDHgA)\n\nHowever, when I click on View logs, you can see it failed:\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMidqWo3FtRiKYPcIjy2ZykQ)\n\n## Issue 2\nAnother (even more severe) bug occured when I ran an incorrect query with awswrangler: an error is never reported, the VM (sagemaker.processing.FrameworkProcessor) just silently shuts down and reports the process as completed.\n\nIn SageMaker -> Studio -> Pipelines, I see it as completed successfully:\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMtymHyd0QQIKsD57oUdZAew)\n\nWhen I click on the logs, I see no errors this time (even though the files that should be produced by this process are not on S3):\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMvOtdRG3ZSIedi5h5bw5RqA)\n\nIf I follow the link to cloudwatch, I also see no errors. I see the query that the script prints before using `awswrangler.redshift.unload`. You can see that it contains characters `'` which should be replaced\/escaped by `\\'`, hence it fails. After that print, just silence. No error reported:\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMOk7IYodTT6yHrbhLneSI-Q)\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMepPcAlavTw2pWzJye616Bg)\n\nHowever, if I copy-paste that query to jupyter, connect from a local laptop to the redshift DB and execute the query, I get the error:\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMkIIolCiMQwC0C5axCna7Ig)\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMFizk0hWYTbuvo14df3IPKg)\n\nEdit: In the second to last picture, I can see that an error is actually reported in CloudWatch, but is not the last entry in the log. Why are entries chronologically shuffled? Or asked differently, why do so many entries in the log have the exact same time (clearly they couldn't have happened simultaneously)?",

        "Question_body":"I'm trying to figure out a minimally permissive yet operational network configuration for Amazon SageMaker training to train on data from Amazon FSx for Lustre. My understanding is that both the file system and the SageMaker instance can have their own security groups and that FSx uses TCP on ports 988 and 1021-1023. Therefore, I think a good network configuration for using SageMaker with FSx is the following:\n* SageMaker EC2 equipped with the security group SM-SG that allows Inbound only with TCP on 988 and 1021-1023 from FSX-SG only.\n* Amazon FSx equipped with the security group FSX-SG that allows outbound only with TCP on 988 and 1021-1023 towards SM-SG only.\nIs this configuration enough for the training to work? Do FSx and SageMaker need other ports and sources to be opened to operate normally?",

        "Answer_body":"For the security group for Amazon FSx (Example: FSx-SG), you need to add the following additional rules:\n\n1. FSx-SG needs inbound access from the security group for SageMaker (Example: SM-SG). The SageMaker instance needs to initiate a connection to the Amazon FSx file system, which is an inbound TCP packet to FSx.\n2. FSx-SG needs inbound and outbound access to itself. This is because, Amazon FSx for Lustre is a clustered file system, where each file system is typically powered by multiple file servers, and the file servers need to  communicate with one another.\n\nFor more information on the minimum set of rules required for FSx-SG, see [File system access control with Amazon VPC][1].\n[1]: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/fsx\/latest\/LustreGuide\/limit-access-security-groups.html",

I created an estimator with a metrics definition for the validation binary accuracy of the trained model as seen below:\n```\nestimator = TensorFlow(entry_point=code_entry,\n                   source_dir=code_dir,\n                   role=sagemaker_role,\n                   instance_type='local',\n                   instance_count=1,\n                   model_dir='s3:\/\/some-bucket\/model\/',\n                   hyperparameters=hyperparameters,\n                   output_path='s3:\/\/some-bucket\/results\/',\n                   framework_version='2.8',\n                   py_version='py39',\n                   metric_definitions=[\n                        {\n                            \"Name\": \"binary_accuracy\",\n                            \"Regex\": \"val_binary_accuracy=(\\d+\\.\\d+)?\",\n                        }\n                    ],\n                   script_mode=True)\n```\nAccording to [Sagemaker's Estimator documentation][1], by setting the metrics definition, Sagemaker will extract metrics from the training logs using a regex: \n\n> metric_definitions (list[dict[str, str] or list[dict[str, PipelineVariable]]) \u2013 A list of dictionaries that defines the metric(s) used to evaluate the training jobs. Each dictionary contains two keys: \u2018Name\u2019 for the name of the metric, and \u2018Regex\u2019 for the regular expression used to extract the metric from the logs. \n\nThe trained model metrics are then available in the properties of the training job in the `FinalMetricDataList`object.\n \nIn the training logs I can see the log below, which matches the regex in the estimator's metrics definition: \n\n    2wn9x0rkaf-algo-1-43gci | INFO:root:val_binary_accuracy=0.5\n\nBut when I try to access the metric with the code below:\n\n    step_training.properties.FinalMetricDataList['binary_accuracy'].Value\n\n... I get the following error in my conditional step that checks if the metric is higher than a threshold: \n\n     Pipeline step 'CheckAccuracyEvaluation' FAILED. Failure message is: {'Get': \"Steps.TrainingStep.FinalMetricDataList['binary_accuracy'].Value\"} is undefined.\n\nI really don't understand why the binary_accuracy metric is undefined. The training model step always conclude successfully.\n\nHow to get the metrics from a trained model using an estimator with script mode?  \n\nThank you in advance!\n\n\n  [1]: https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/api\/training\/estimators.html",

Data scientist is looking at having the SageMaker inference model plugged in as a Kinesis Data Analytics Application but Kinesis Data Analytics currently only supports SQL or Flink.\n\nOne option to set up an ECS or Lambda service to consume data from Kinesis or SNS and invoke the SageMaker inference endpoint per message, but  if there is a more automated and optimal solution available for these kind of workflows.\n\nIt is not possible to pass multiple requests currently to a SageMaker endpoint, yet Tensorflow models tend to perform much better on batches of data rather than multiple single invocations so some windowing would be beneficial. Ideally the client would want to react to an inference within 10-15 seconds of the event being processed so an S3 based batch approach is probably too slow.\n\nIs there anything you can recommend for handling this sort of workload?",

The expected behavior is to scale in the instance count to zero when there are no requests and scale up when at least one request comes.  Its working as expected. However when I check the cloud watch alarms , I could see that the alarm for scale in remain in the state of 'in Alarm' even after the instance count reduces to zero. Is this the normal behavior?

This means step scaling is considerably more flexible and configurable than Target Tracking, but the trade off is that its much more work to configure it (especially via code\/IaC).",

I was not getting any inferences from the deployed model and it always errors out with the message:\n\n```\nAn error occurred (ModelError) when calling the InvokeEndpoint operation: Received server error (0) from <users-sagemaker-endpoint> with message \"Your invocation timed out while waiting for a response from container model. Review the latency metrics for each container in Amazon CloudWatch, resolve the issue, and try again.\"                \n```\nAccording to the troubleshoot docs [https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/neo-troubleshooting-inference.html](), this seems to be an issue of **model_fn**() function.\nThe inference script used by this example is mentioned here [https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/amazon-sagemaker-examples\/blob\/main\/sagemaker_neo_compilation_jobs\/pytorch_torchvision\/code\/resnet18.py]() , which itself doesn't contain any model_fn() definition but it still worked for target device `ml_c5`.\nSo could anyone please help me with the following questions:\n1. What changes does SageMaker Neo do to the model depending on `target_device` type? Since it seems the same model is loaded in a different way for different target device.\n2. Is there any way to determine how the model is expected to load for a certain target_device type so that I could define the **model_fn**() function myself in the same inference script mentioned above?\n3. At-last, can anyone please help with the inference script for this very same model as mentioned in docs above which works for `jetson_tx2` device as well.\n\nAny suggestions or links on how to resolve this issue would be really helpful.",

Thanks for any help!\n\nIn my notebook I have:\n\n```\nfrom sagemaker.pytorch.model import PyTorchModel\nmodel_bucket = .......\npytorch_model = PyTorchModel(\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0model_data= model_bucket, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0role=role,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0entry_point='inference.py', \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0py_version=\"py39\",\n    framework_version=\"1.13\",\n)\n```\n\nMy inference.py holds:\n\n```\ndef model_fn(model_dir):\n    pass\ndef input_fn(request_body, request_content_type):\n    pass\ndef predict_fn(input_data, model):\n    pass\ndef output_fn(prediction, content_type):\n    pass\n```",

        "Answer_body":"Hi Basem,\n\nIf I understood correctly you'd like your Lambda function to automatically choose the latest SageMaker model when it runs, instead of hard-coding the model name.\n\nAlthough you *could* do this simply with [boto3.client(\"sagemaker\").list_models(...)](https:\/\/boto3.amazonaws.com\/v1\/documentation\/api\/latest\/reference\/services\/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.list_models) (which can sort by creation time), I would not recommend it. The reason is that in general this lists *all* models present in SageMaker - which might include some for different use cases in future, even if you only have the one DeepAR forecasting use-case today. You'd have to manually filter after the API call.\n\nA **better approach** would probably be to register your forecasting models in [SageMaker Model Registry](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/model-registry.html) - which will allow you to register different versions and track extra metadata like metrics and approval status for each version if you need.\n\n- First (e.g. from your notebook) you can [create a model package group](https:\/\/boto3.amazonaws.com\/v1\/documentation\/api\/latest\/reference\/services\/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.create_model_package_group) to track your forecasting models.\n- Then (when you create your SageMaker Model) you can **register** it as a new version in the group - via [Model.register()](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/api\/inference\/model.html#sagemaker.model.Model.register).\n- At the point you want to look up which model to use, you can then [list_model_packages](https:\/\/boto3.amazonaws.com\/v1\/documentation\/api\/latest\/reference\/services\/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.list_model_packages) which can filter to your specific group of models, and also by approval status if you like.\n\nSo for example you could set the model package group name as a configuration environment variable for your Lambda function, and have the function dynamically look up the latest version to use from the group when needed.\n\nOf course there are also many more custom ways to do this such as creating an SSM Parameter to track the name of your current accepted model, or creating your own model registry using a data store like DynamoDB... But SageMaker Model Registry seems like the most purpose-built tool for the job here to me.",

        "Question_body":"Hi there,  \nIs it possible for the lifecycle scripts to access the content of the checkout-ed git repository? A use case would be to access the already available in the repository pip requirements file and to populate the notebook instance with the required python modules on start up.  \nI guess the answer to this question depends on the order of the executed events when a notebook is created. Are you executing the lifecycle scripts first and then checkout the repository or vice versa.  \n  \nThanks!  \n  \nEdit:  \n  \nWell, I did my experiment as follows.  \n  \nI added a simple 'ls -al SageMaker' in the start and create lifecycle scripts and inspected the logs.  \nIt seems that on initial notebook instance creation the git repository is checked out after the execution of the start and create scripts.  \nOn subsequent notebook starts, the start script is executed and the repository folder is present in the SageMaker folder with a timestamp indicating that the repository folder was created after the initial start\/create scripts executions.  \n  \nSo, can someone confirm that this is what's expected and that we can access the repository only on subsequent notebook starts?  \n  \nEdited by: ainkov on Apr 3, 2019 7:25 AM",

        "Question_body":"TLDR: if we are trying to use a HuggingFaceProcessor\/Estimator in a Sagemaker Studio project, what are the requirements for the `train.py` file in terms of how it refers to the assembled training data, and where it should store the results of the operations it performs( e.g. compiled model, datae etc.)\n\n-----------------------\nFULL DETAILS\n------------------------\n\nSo our high level goal is to be able to deploy some kind of non-XGB model from a sagemaker studio project, given that the templates provided are all XGB.  As outlined in [an earlier question](https:\/\/repost.aws\/questions\/QUdd2zOBY0Q4CEG1ZdbgNsgA\/using-transformers-module-with-sagemaker-studio-project-module-not-found-error-no-module-named-transformers) we'd started with TensorFlow, but since our TensorFlow model wraps a HuggingFace model we thought let's try something even simpler, just a HuggingFace model using the HuggingFaceProcessor.\n\nSo following docs on [HuggingFaceProcessor](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/processing-job-frameworks-hugging-face.html) and a [HuggingFace Estimator](https:\/\/github.com\/huggingface\/notebooks\/blob\/main\/sagemaker\/02_getting_started_tensorflow\/sagemaker-notebook.ipynb) example we started to adjust the abalone (project template) pipeline.py to look like this (full code can be provided on request):\n\n```\n    #

To test, I use curl with a JSON payload to make a request. When I run the created docker container on my local machine I can successfully invoke it and get responses back. So I don't think the problem is in the docker image.\n\nWhen I deploy to sagemaker, I receive the message `{\"message\":\"Service Unavailable\"}` as a response to my curl request. I can see the endpoint running in the Sagemaker\/Endpoints dashboard. Viewing the cloudwatch logs, it appears that the the endpoint is constantly restarting. There are messages that are printed at startup (e.g. Tensorflow loading messages) that are written to the log over and over.\n\nI thought that this might be due to using an instance type with low memory (t2.medium) so I switched to m5.4xlarge as a test, but the result is the same.\n\nWhat can I do?

The model is unique to each device, however its architecture and invocation logic are the same for all devices. In other words, the same invocation Lambda could be the same for all devices, only the model parameters would need to change across devices. We'd like to deploy a unique inference Lambda to all devices, and load device-specific artifact to each device.\n\nCan this be achieved with Greengrass ML Inference? It seems that GG MLI requires each model to be associated with a specific Lambda. \n\nOtherwise, is the recommended pattern to self-manage the inference in Lambda? E.g. by loading a specific model from S3 unique a local config file or some env variable?",

This is similar to using one of the GG ML connectors (Object Detection or Image Classification).\n\nIn addition to your inference code, you'll also need to configure an ML Resource, which has a local name and a remote model. The local name would be the same for all Greengrass Groups, but in each group you will refer to a different remote object (the model) - either S3 or SageMaker job.\n\nEvery time a model changes, you will need to redeploy the corresponding Greengrass group for the changes to be deployed locally.",

The tables have some columns that are the same (in name) and some that are not, many of the rows are missing entries for many of the columns.  The two tables represent separate datasets. Consider the example below:\nTable 1:\n\n| Filename | LabelA | LabelB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| .\/A\/001.dat | 1 | 1 |\n| .\/A\/002.dat | 0 | 1 |\n\n\nTable 2:\n\n| Filename | LabelB | LabelC |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| .\/B\/001.dat |  | 0 |\n| .\/B\/002.dat | 0 | 1 |\n\nI am looking to merge \/ concatenate the two table.  The problem is that neither Data Wrangler join nor concatenate seems to work (at least as expected).\n\nDesired result:\n\n| Filename | LabelA | LabelB | LabelC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| .\/A\/001.dat | 1 | 1 | |\n| .\/A\/002.dat | 0 | 1 | |\n| .\/B\/001.dat | | | 0 |\n| .\/B\/002.dat | | 0 | 1 |\n\nWhen using a \"Full Outer\" join and ask to combine \"Filename\" and \"LabelB\" columns, it will take all the values from Table 1 OR Table 2 even if Table 1 does not have that entry (for example, some rows will have Filename = <nothing> rather than Filename = .\/B\/001.dat).\n\nWhen using concatenate, Data Wrangler errors on the fact that it cannot match EVERY column between the tables.\n\nNow in my example there are many columns and many rows which precludes a manual process of joining without merging columns and then going through a renaming and merging process one-by-one.  How do get these tables to simply merge?  I feel I must be missing something obvious.  I am about to give up on Data Wrangler and do it all in a python script using pandas, but I thought I should give Data Wrangler a try while learning the MLops process.",

For start, it would be good to see a specific issue in cloudwatch and then try to resolve the problem with failed jobs.\n\nThe logs show the following (I filtered out repeating events for different input objects):\n\n```\n{\n    \"labeling-job-name\": \"test-job51\",\n    \"event-name\": \"INPUT_REQUEST_VALIDATED\",\n    \"event-log-message\": \"Input request validated.\"\n}\n{\n    \"labeling-job-name\": \"test-job51\",\n    \"event-name\": \"CREATED_WORKER_INTERFACE\",\n    \"event-log-message\": \"Human task UI created.\"\n}\n{\n    \"labeling-job-name\": \"test-job51\",\n    \"event-name\": \"INPUT_MANIFEST_PARSED\",\n    \"event-log-message\": \"Input manifest parsed successfully.\"\n}\n{\n    \"labeling-job-name\": \"test-job51\",\n    \"event-name\": \"PRE_HUMAN_LAMBDA_INVOKED\",\n    \"event-log-message\": \"Pre-human task Lambda invoked for line 6.\"\n}\n{\n    \"labeling-job-name\": \"test-job51\",\n    \"event-name\": \"PRE_HUMAN_LAMBDA_SUCCEEDED\",\n    \"event-log-message\": \"Pre-human task Lambda returned successfully for line 6.\"\n}\n{\n    \"labeling-job-name\": \"test-job51\",\n    \"event-name\": \"HUMAN_TASK_CREATED\",\n    \"event-log-message\": \"Human task created successfully for line 6.\"\n}\n{\n    \"event-name\": \"HUMAN_TASK_COMPLETED\",\n    \"event-log-message\": \"Human task completed successfully for line 6.\",\n    \"labeling-job-name\": \"test-job51\"\n}\n{\n    \"labeling-job-name\": \"test-job51\",\n    \"event-name\": \"LABELING_JOB_PROGRESS\",\n    \"event-log-message\": \"Labeling job progress for batch number:1 | #Total data set objects:2 | #Data set objects completed:0 | #Data set objects waiting for humans:0 | #Data set objects failed:2 | #Data set objects expired:0 | #Data set objects cancelled:0\"\n}\n```\n\n\nThe setup goes as follows\n- using VPC\n- using Private Labelling team\n- CORS set on S3 bucket (per suggestion from `https:\/\/repost.aws\/knowledge-center\/sagemaker-ground-truth-errors`)\n- the execution role has permission to use cloudwatch (per suggestion from https:\/\/repost.aws\/knowledge-center\/sagemaker-ground-truth-errors)\n- Cognito App callback url is `https:\/\/XXX.labeling.us-east-1.sagemaker.aws\/oauth2\/idpresponse` and logout URL is `https:\/\/XXX.labeling.us-east-1.sagemaker.aws\/logout` (I noticed that when the labelling job\/workforce is created from Console, there is an additional allowed callback `https:\/\/XXX.cloudfront.net`; I did not add it)",

        "Answer_body":"Hi Yann, the user profile's execution role is what will be used within the context of the private app of the user profile. So, once a user hits Launch -> Studio or is redirected to Studio UI through SSO, the user's execution role will allow them to launch apps such as data science app, data wrangler app, etc.\n\nThe default space execution role is what is assumed by the user once they are in a shared space. So, once the user is in the UI by clicking Launch -> Spaces, the user cannot create apps to run notebooks in, within that space.\n\nTL;DR - they are two distinct roles, each giving the user permissions on a private space or a shared space, and do not work like SCPs. Any user in the shared space within a domain, will share the same execution role as of today. However, for the private space, each user profile can have their own role if needed.",

        "Question_body":"Hello,\nI've been trying to deploy multiple PyTorch models on one endpoint on SageMaker from a SageMaker Notebook. First I tested deployment of single models on single endpoints, to check if everything works smoothly and it did. I would create a PyTorchModel first:\n\n```\nimport sagemaker\nfrom sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorchModel\nfrom sagemaker import get_execution_role\nfrom sagemaker.multidatamodel import MultiDataModel\nfrom sagemaker.serializers import JSONSerializer\nfrom sagemaker.deserializers import JSONDeserializer\nimport boto3\n\nrole = get_execution_role()\nsagemaker_session = sagemaker.Session()\n\npytorch_model = PyTorchModel(\n            entry_point='inference.py',\n            source_dir='code',\n            role=role,\n            model_data='s3:\/\/***\/model\/model.tar.gz',\n            framework_version='1.11.0',\n            py_version='py38',\n            name='***-model',\n            sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session\n        )\n```\nMultiDataModel inherits properties from Model classes, so I used the same PyTorch model that I used for single model deployment.\nThen I would define the MultiDataModel the following way:\n\n```\nmodels = MultiDataModel(name='***-multi-model',\n                       model_data_prefix='s3:\/\/***-sagemaker\/model\/',\n                       model=pytorch_model,\n                       sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session\n                       )\n```\nAll it should need is the prefix to the S3 bucket of the model artifacts saved as tar.gz files (the same files used for single model deployment), the previously defined PyTorch model, a name and a sagemaker_session.\n\nTo deploy it:\n```\nmodels.deploy(initial_instance_count =1,\n             instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',\n             serializer=JSONSerializer(),\n             deserializer=JSONDeserializer(),\n             endpoint_name='***-multi-model-deployment',\n             )\n```\n\nThe deployment goes well, as there are no failures and the endpoint is InService by the end of this step.\nHowever the error occurs when I try to run inference on one of the models:\n\n```\nimport json\nbody = {\"url\":\"https:\/\/***image.jpg\"} #url to an image online\npayload = json.dumps(body)\nclient = boto3.client('sagemaker-runtime')\nresponse = client.invoke_endpoint(\n    EndpointName = \"***-multi-model-deployment\",\n    ContentType  = \"application\/json\",\n    TargetModel  = \"\/model.tar.gz\",\n    Body         = payload)\n```\n\nThis prompts an error message: \n\n```\nModelError: An error occurred (ModelError) when calling the InvokeEndpoint operation: Received server error (500) from model with message \"{\n  \"code\": 500,\n  \"type\": \"InternalServerException\",\n  \"message\": \"Failed to start workers for model ec1cd509c40ca81ffc3fb09deb4599e2 version: 1.0\"\n}\n\".

        "Answer_body":"Hi, this warning is simply to clarify that running in a pipeline session will defer execution of jobs - generating pipeline step definitions instead of kicking off the jobs straight away.\n\nFor example calls such as `Estimator.fit()` or `Processor.run()` when using a pipeline session won't **start a job** (or wait for it to complete, or stream logs from CloudWatch), just prepare a definition to build up a pipeline that can be started later.\n\nIf you're already familiar with how PipelineSession works, I would say you can ignore it :-)  If not, can refer to the [SDK docs here for more details](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/amazon_sagemaker_model_building_pipeline.html#pipeline-session).\n\nCould be that there's an inconsistency between `LocalPipelineSession` versus `PipelineSession` in showing the message? Or that you disagree this message should be at warning level... Either way I'd suggest raising an issue on the [SageMaker Python SDK GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-python-sdk) might be a good way to log that feedback with the team!",

        "Answer_comment_body":"@Alex_T - thanks. I agree cloudformation might not be a good fit. I was trying to see if there was any other way to create the jobs itself, define bunch of parameters and push\/build stack via cloudformation or something similar and then trigger the jobs with ways like you suggested. but sounds like the creating jobs part is also possible only via sdk",
        "Answer_body":"While CloudFormation doesn't currently offer a resource for a SageMaker Batch Transform ([resource list here in the docs](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AWSCloudFormation\/latest\/UserGuide\/AWS_SageMaker.html)), there are plenty of other integration points to automate running these jobs.\n\n### CloudFormation\n\nI'd actually argue that CloudFormation is probably not a great fit for this anyway because CloudFormation defines **resources** which can be created, updated, and deleted. I could maybe see a correspondence between \"Create\" = \"Run a job\", maybe \"Delete\" = \"Delete job outputs\", and possibly \"Update\" = \"Re-run the job\"? But these are opinionated choices that might not make sense in every case.\n\nIf you really wanted, you could create a [Custom CloudFormation resource](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AWSCloudFormation\/latest\/UserGuide\/template-custom-resources.html) backed by an AWS Lambda function using the [CreateTransformJob API](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_CreateTransformJob.html) (via whatever language you prefer e.g. [boto3 in Python](https:\/\/boto3.amazonaws.com\/v1\/documentation\/api\/latest\/reference\/services\/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.create_transform_job)).\n\nNote that:\n- If you wanted to use the [SageMaker Python SDK](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/) (`import sagemaker`, `Transformer`, etc) instead of the low-level boto3 interface in Python - you'd need to install this extra library in your Lambda function. Tools like AWS SAM and CDK can help with this.\n- The maximum Lambda timeout is 15 minutes, you may not want to keep your Lambda function running (billable) just waiting for the transform to complete anyway, and even the overall Custom Resource will have a longer max timeout within which it must stabilize after a create\/update\/delete request... So additional orchestration may be required beyond a single synchronous Lambda function call.\n\n### Other (better?) options\n\nAs mentioned above, you can create, describe and stop SageMaker Batch Transform jobs from any environment where you're able to call AWS APIs \/ use AWS SDKs... And you can even use the high-level open-source `sagemaker` SDK from anywhere you install it. Interesting options might include:\n\n- [Amazon SageMaker Pipelines](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/pipelines.html): SageMaker Pipelines have native \"steps\" for a range of SageMaker processes, including transform jobs but also training, pre-processing and more. You can define a multi-step pipeline from the SageMaker Python SDK (in your notebook or elsewhere) and then start it running on-demand (with parameters) by calling the [StartPipelineExecution API](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_StartPipelineExecution.html).\n- [AWS Step Functions](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/step-functions\/latest\/dg\/welcome.html): Step Functions provides general-purpose serverless orchestration so while the orchestration for SageMaker jobs in particular might be a little more complex (one step to start the job, then a polling check to check wait for completion) - the visual workflow editor and range of integrations to other services may be useful.\n- [Amazon S3 Lambda integrations](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/lambda\/latest\/dg\/with-s3.html) can trigger an event automatically (to start your transform job) when new data is uploaded to Amazon S3.\n- [Scheduled EventBridge Rules](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/eventbridge\/latest\/userguide\/eb-create-rule-schedule.html) can run actions on a regular schedule (such as calling Lambda functions, kicking off these pipelines, etc) - in case you need a schedule-based execution rather than in response to some event.\n\nThe choice will depend on what the initial trigger for your workflow would be (schedule? Data upload? Some other AWS event? An API call from outside AWS?) and what other steps need to be orchestrated as well as your transform job in the overall flow.",

Therefore, we eliminate following options: async inference, serverless, batch transform and leaving only 1 option left : real-time inference. In Real-time inference, there are 4 options :\n \n- Host single model - https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/realtime-single-model.html  :\u2028Fastest way to get inference from 1 ML model.\u2028\n- Host multi models in 1 container behind 1 endpoint - https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/multi-model-endpoints.html :\u2028https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/multi-model-endpoints.html \u2028\u2028Multi-model endpoints are ideal for hosting a large number of models that use the same ML framework on a shared serving container. If you have a mix of frequently and infrequently accessed models, a multi-model endpoint can efficiently serve this traffic with fewer resources and higher cost savings. Your application should be tolerant of occasional cold start-related latency penalties that occur when invoking infrequently used models.\u2028\n- Host multi models which use different containers behind 1 endpoint - https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/multi-container-endpoints.html :\u2028SageMaker multi-container endpoints enable customers to deploy multiple containers, that use different models or frameworks, on a single SageMaker endpoint. The containers can be run in a sequence as an inference pipeline, or each container can be accessed individually by using direct invocation to improve endpoint utilization and optimize costs.\u2028\n- (Eliminated) Host models along with pre-processing logic as serial inference pipeline behind one endpoint - https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/inference-pipelines.html \n- Note: What ever option we choose above, we all enable Auto-Scaling feature: https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/endpoint-auto-scaling.html\n\nSo, we narrow it down to only 3 options for deployment, you can create a survey about your ML Models deployment details (a statistics for the following information of each model : framework, inference latency, GPU usage type). \n\nFor those models are frequently accessed (inference latency <~60s) , you can choose \u201cHost Single Model\u201d ; Otherwise, for those aren\u2019t frequently accessed, if they use the same ML framework, choose \u201cHost multi models in 1 container behind 1 endpoint\u201d, if they use different ML framework, choose \u201cHost multi models which use different containers behind 1 endpoint\u201d.",

        "Question_body":"Hi,\n I am using Jupyter Notebook on SageMaker with PySpark kernel. I want to implement some data checks so that the processing of the notebook is stopped if some conditions is meet. For Python kernel one can simply use raise statement as in the example below. If the notebook was run using \"Run All\" button then the code below would stop not only the execution of the error cell, but it would **not proceed to the next cells**. \n```\nif type(age) is not int:\n    raise TypeError(\"Age must be an integer\")\nelif age < 0:\n    raise ValueError(\"Sorry you can't be born in the future\")\n```\nHowever, if we use the same piece of code with PySpark kernel, execution of the error cell would be stopped but the notebook would still proceed with the execution of the next cells (as \"Run All\" was used). So in fact calculations would be proceeded even if age is not integer or is < 0. \n\nHow to force PySpark kernel to stop executing the entire notebook on error, just as it is the case for Python kernel?\n\nAdding a print screen with output notebook after \"Run All\": \n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IM4NPOObXJTXWuNvt7ZhL8aw)",

It estimates parameters for each worker and uses Bayesian inference to estimate the true class based on the class annotations from individual workers.\" Is there anywhere I can get more information and detail on this consolidation process? For now, I am trying to understand what this looks like when I have only 2 labelers per object, but I would also want to get a deeper understanding of how this works in general.  \n  \n(2)  \nIs there anywhere I can get more information on the neural networks used in the automatic labeling component of Ground Truth? Is there a way to access and customize them? Also, is there a way to export\/pickle the models and use them outside of Ground Truth?  \n  \n(3)  \nLastly, in https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/sms-automated-labeling.html, it says: \"The potential benefit of automated data labeling also depends on the accuracy that you require. Higher accuracy levels generally reduce the number of data objects that are automatically labeled.\" Where is this accuracy level set?  \n  \nThank you!",

However, note that Studio at this time does not support building Docker images out of the box. You can use [SageMaker Notebook Instances](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/nbi.html) instead.\n\nI would recommend keeping the model (.tar.gz) and the image (Docker) separate, since you can easily retrain and deploy the newer versions of models without updating the image every single time.",

        "Answer_body":"Hi there!\n\nIn short, our SageMaker scikit-learn container do not currently support model specific inference script.\n\nThe entry_point script that you referenced in your MultiDataModel object will be the inference script used for all the models. If you've added logging in your script, you will be able to see them in CloudWatch logs.\n\nIf you have some pre\/post-processing script that needs to be performed on a specific model, you need to write them all in one universal inference.py . You can then add some extra attributes in your data when invoking the endpoint and have the same script read the extra attribute so it knows which pre\/post-processing script to perform.\n\nOne important thing to note is that although you reference a model object in MultiDataModel, i.e.\n\n```\n\nmme = MultiDataModel(\n    name='model',\n    model_data_prefix=model_data_prefix,\n    model= cluster_model,\n    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,\n)\n```\n\n\nThe only information fetched from the model object is the image_uri and entry_point, these information is needed for during endpoint deployment.\n\nAll the model.tar.gz sitting in 'model_data_prefix' should not have a inference.py as it confuses the container and forces it to go back to default handler, hence why you're probably receiving ModelError.\n\n\nTry something like below:\n\n\n```\ncluster_model = SKLearnModel(\n    model_data=cluster_artifact,\n    role=role,\n    entry_point=\"scripts\/cluster_inference.py\",\n    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session\n)\npca_model = SKLearnModel(\n    model_data=pca_artifact,\n    role=role,\n    entry_point=\"scripts\/pca_inference.py\",\n    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session\n)\nmme = MultiDataModel(\n    name='model',\n    model_data_prefix=model_data_prefix,\t#make sure the directory of this prefix is empty, i.e. no models in this location\n    model= cluster_model,\n    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,\n)\n\n\nlist(mme.list_models()) # this should be empty\n\nmme.add_model(model_data_source=cluster_artifact, model_data_path='cluster_artifact.tar.gz')\t#make sure model artifact doesn't contain inference.py\nmme.add_model(model_data_source=pca_artifact, model_data_path='pca_artifact.tar.gz') #make sure model artifact doesn't contain inference.py\n\nlist(mme.list_models()) # there should be two models listed now, if you look at the location of model_data_prefix, there should also be two model artifact\n\noutput_cluster = predictor.predict(data='<your-data>', target_model='cluster_artifact.tar.gz')\nprint(output_cluster) #this should work since it's using the inference.py from cluster_inference.py\n\noutput_pca = predictor.predict(data='<your-data>', target_model='pca_artifact.tar.gz')\nprint(output_pca) \t#this might fail since it's using cluster_inference.py, add this model's inference script into cluster_inference.py to make it work \n\n```\n\nI know this approach is not ideal since if you have a new model with new pre\/post-processing script, you'd have to redeploy your endpoint for the new script to come into effect.\n\nWe actually just added support in our tensorflow container to allow model specific inference script: https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/deep-learning-containers\/pull\/2680\n\nYou can request for the same feature for our scikit container here: https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-scikit-learn-container\/issues",

        "Answer_body":"Vanilla SageMaker \"Models\" (as opposed to versioned ModelPackages) are immutable in the API with no \"UpdateModel\" action... But I think you should be able to create a new Model copying the settings of the current one.\n\nI'd suggest to:\n\n1. Use [DescribeModel](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_DescribeModel.html) (via [boto3.client(\"sagemaker\").describe_model()](https:\/\/boto3.amazonaws.com\/v1\/documentation\/api\/latest\/reference\/services\/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.describe_model), assuming you're using Python) to fetch all the parameters of the existing JumpStart model such as the S3 artifact location and other settings\n2. Use [CreateModel](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_CreateModel.html) ([create_model()](https:\/\/boto3.amazonaws.com\/v1\/documentation\/api\/latest\/reference\/services\/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.create_model)) to create a new model with same configuration but network isolation disabled\n3. Use your new model to try and deploy an async endpoint\n\nProbably you'd find the low-level boto3 SDK more intuitive for this task than the high-level `sagemaker` SDK's [Model class](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/api\/inference\/model.html) - because the latter does some magic that makes typical build\/train\/deploy workflows easier but can be less natural for hacking around with existing model definitions. For example, creating an SMSDK `Model` object doesn't actually create a Model in the SageMaker API, because deployment instance type affects choice of container image so that gets deferred until a `.deploy()` call or similar later.",

Navigating and manipulating this dataset is slower in Studio because of the extra metadata introduced by the communication being at filesystem level, rather than just a block storage device.\n\nI know there's a little ephemeral block storage available to notebooks under `\/tmp` which can help with these issues (as [used here](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/sagemaker-101-workshop\/blob\/e5bbabd866375bc1589908d6f83e16b65deb8abe\/migration_challenge_keras_image\/Local%20Notebook.ipynb), in fact), but thought it would be more scalable to make use of the proper NVMe instance storage available with `ml.m5d.*` instances in Studio to work with bigger datasets.\n\nOnly trouble is, I'm not sure how to use these instance storage volume(s) from notebooks?

Or if your algorithm is returning something similar in the result... You could try to temporarily reduce your MaxPayloadInMB and\/or set SINGLE_RECORD strategy to reduce payload req\/res size and help with the logging? Thank you for your comment.\n\nI do not have any single or double quotes. It's a very simple model for learning to use SageMaker.\n\nMy input file is 175 mb. I wanted to let SageMaker \"chunk\" it.\n\nI get the same behavior with MaxPayloadInMB set to 4, as well as set to 1.\n\nI have tried SINGLE_RECORD and did not get any errors for that job (I stopped it early, after 24 minutes). You need to post the details of the `CreateTransformJobRequest` you are sending. Of particular import: `BatchStrategy`, `MaxConcurrentTransforms`, `TransformInput`,`SplitType`, `ContentType` arguments. And also verify that it works with a simple csv file that you are 100% sure is formatted correctly I've tested with smaller files and those sometimes work. There's some kind of race condition with how SageMaker posts to our server, but there isn't enough information to know what the problem is. Can't SageMaker be made to write more logs?\n\nBatchStrategy=MultiRecord.\nMaxConcurrentTransforms=1, on an ml.m5.2xlarge.\nSplitType=Line.\nCompression=None.\nContentType=text\/csv.\n\nEdit: MaxConcurrentTransform=1. If it works sometimes, doesn't that strongly suggest that the failure is data related on your end? it's unlikely anyone can help unless you post an exact minimal csv file that you can consistently demonstrate is failing There are NO errors in my logs.

Now I can create a multi-model endpoint in SageMaker using the same s3 directory as the model path and using the above code. Once the endpoint is ready, I can do inference by providing the target model.\nPlease let me know if my understanding is correct and share any relevant documents to follow for my use case.",

        "Question_body":"When there are multiple concurrent InvokeEndpoint requests being called to a deployed AWS Sagemaker endpoint, how is it being handled?  \n  \nI have deployed an endpoint with a P3.2xlarge instance. Currently one job takes around ~45 seconds to process. I have tried sending 4 different InvokeEndpoint requests at the same time and I noticed from CloudWatch logs that the jobs are being done serially depending on which request arrives first. --I suspect there is some sort of queue internally within the server model itself.--  \n  \nI am aware of automatic scaling as described here: https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/\/blogs\/machine-learning\/load-test-and-optimize-an-amazon-sagemaker-endpoint-using-automatic-scaling\/ but my question is by default does aws sagemaker not allow concurrent requests being handled at the same time?  \n  \n**UPDATE**  \nUpon further investigation and testing here are some additional information.   \nI have deployed an ml.m4xlarge instance that simply sleeps for 45 seconds inside the transform function. Looks somewhat like\n\n```\ndef transform_fn(model, request_body, content_type, accept_type):       \r\n    request_body_dict = json.loads(request_body)\r\n    time.sleep(45)\r\n    ...\n```\n\nFurthermore, I have set the server timeout to be 420 seconds like so. \n\n```\nsagemaker_model = MXNetModel(model_data = 's3:\/\/' + sagemaker_session.default_bucket() + '\/model\/yolo_object_person_detector.tar.gz',\r\n                             role = role, \r\n                             entry_point = 'load_testing_entrypoint.py',\r\n                             py_version='py3',\r\n                             framework_version='1.4.1',\r\n                             sagemaker_session = sagemaker_session,\r\n                            env = {'SAGEMAKER_MODEL_SERVER_TIMEOUT' : '420' })\r\n\r\npredictor = sagemaker_model.deploy(\r\n                            initial_instance_count=1,\r\n                            instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',\r\n                            endpoint_name='load-testing')\n```\n\nI tried sending 9 consecutive requests and monitored how they are being executed and what I've found is that there is no specific order in which the requests are being handled.  \n  \nA few questions I have from this experiment is:  \n1) Does AWS Sagemaker not process requests concurrently? Meaning, I would expect the server being able to handle two requests at the same time?  \n2) From the client's side, how is it handling the case when the server is busy? I notice that it internally does retries for about 3 times after every 60 seconds if the request is not being handled  \n3) Within each of the 60 seconds time window, how is the client code calling the Endpoint? Is it constantly calling after every 1,2,4,6,8 seconds ?   \n  \nHere is the client side code \n\n```\nsagemaker_client = boto3.client('sagemaker-runtime')\r\nresponse = sagemaker_client.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName='load-testing',Body=request_body)\n```\n\nEdited by: ptanugraha on Nov 14, 2019 10:44 AM",

I followed this tutorial: https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/machine-learning\/speed-up-training-on-amazon-sagemaker-using-amazon-efs-or-amazon-fsx-for-lustre-file-systems\/.\n\nCode:\n\n```\nimport sagemaker\nfrom sagemaker import get_execution_role\nfrom sagemaker.estimator import Estimator\n\nsess = sagemaker.Session()\n\nestimator = Estimator(image_uri='image-uri',\n                      role='my-role',\n                      base_job_name='training-job',\n                      instance_count=1,\n                      sagemaker_session=sess,\n                      instance_type='ml.m5.xlarge',  # ml.p3.2xlarge\n                      subnets=['subnet-id'],\n                      security_group_ids=['sg-id', 'sg-id'],\n                      hyperparameters={...} \n                     )\n\nfrom sagemaker.inputs import FileSystemInput\n\ntrain_input = FileSystemInput(file_system_id = 'fs-id',\n                              file_system_type = 'FSxLustre',\n                              directory_path = '\/mount-idea\/dataset',\n                              file_system_access_mode = 'rw')\n\nestimator.fit(train_input)\n```\n\nFirst issue is that I don't have internet connection in the container, and second is this error:\n\n```\nUnexpectedStatusException: Error for Training job training-job: Failed. Reason: ClientError: Artifact upload failed:Please ensure that the subnet's route table has a route to an S3 VPC endpoint or a NAT device, and both the security groups and the subnet's network ACL allow uploading data to all output URIs\n```\n\nI have create a custom VPC for this with private and public subnets. I enabled NAT and S3 endpoint. I am using one of the public subnet so that I can have access to internet. I created custom security group rules (inbound\/outbound) with Custom TCP for port 988 and ports 1018 - 1023 for the security groups I use.\n\nThe code is running in a sagemaker notebook that has as VPC, the custom VPC I created and uses same subnet and security groups as the ones pass to the estimator.\n\nWhat should I do to fix this error?\n\nThank you!",

On the compute studio (jupyter) itself: [Studio UI] > File > New > Terminal \n\nIn both options your personal files folder is accessible. In a kernel terminal: \/root. In a Jupyter terminal: \/home\/sagemaker-user.  \nWhen opening a kernel terminal you'll have access to the software that is part of the kernel's container (say tensorflow container).

        "Question_body":"I had a Sagemaker user I wasn't using, so I tried to delete it and initially came across this tutorial:\nhttps:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/gs-studio-delete-domain.html . As part of the larger process for how to delete a domain, it shows how to delete any user profiles within that domain. The steps are:\n* Choose the user.\n* On the User Details page, for each non-failed app in the Apps list, choose Delete app.\n* On the Delete app dialog, choose Yes, delete app, type delete in the confirmation field, and then choose Delete.\n* When the Status for all apps show as Deleted, choose Delete user.\n\nThe problem comes on the final step: I wasn't able to find a \"Delete user\" button. This feels like a bug, because without such a button the only way to stop charges on a Sagemaker user is to use the CLI, which I eventually did. You can only delete the domain if you have deleted all users, meaning it only works using the CLI for that as well. For every other AWS service I've used, there is an easy way to delete everything from the GUI.",

        "Answer_body":"As of January 30 2021, you can't deploy an existing model artifact from SageMaker to Redshift ML directly with currently announced Redshift ML preview features. But you can reference  sagemaker endpoint through a lambda function and use that lambda function as an user defined function in Redshift.\n\nBelow would be the steps:\n\n1. Train and deploy your SageMaker model in a SageMaker Endpoint. \n2. Use Lambda function to [reference sagemaker endpoint](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/machine-learning\/call-an-amazon-sagemaker-model-endpoint-using-amazon-api-gateway-and-aws-lambda\/). \n3. Create a [Redshift Lambda UDF](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/big-data\/accessing-external-components-using-amazon-redshift-lambda-udfs\/) referring above lambda function to run predictions.",

Tensorflow version is 2.1. Following the guide at https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-tensorflow-serving-container the following steps have been taken:  \n1. Build TF 2.1 AMI and publish it to AWS ECR after sucessful local testing  \n2. Setting Sagemaker Execution Role Permissions for S3 and ECR.  \n3. Pack saved TF model folder (saved_model.pb, assets, variables) into model.tar.gz  \n4a. Created endpoint with realtime predictor:\n\n```\nimport os\r\nimport sagemaker\r\nfrom sagemaker.tensorflow.serving import Model\r\nfrom sagemaker.tensorflow.model import TensorFlowModel\r\nfrom sagemaker.predictor import json_deserializer, json_serializer, RealTimePredictor\r\nfrom sagemaker.content_types import CONTENT_TYPE_JSON\r\n\r\ndef create_tfs_sagemaker_model():\r\n    sagemaker_session = sagemaker.Session()\r\n    role = 'arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXX:role\/service-role\/AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-XXXXXXX\r\n    bucket = 'XXXXXXX-tf-serving'\r\n    prefix = 'sagemaker\/tfs-test'\r\n    s3_path = 's3:\/\/{}\/{}'.format(bucket, prefix)\r\n    image = 'XXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\/sagemaker-tensorflow-serving:2.1.0-cpu'\r\n    model_data = sagemaker_session.upload_data('model.tar.gz', bucket, os.path.join(prefix, 'model'))\r\n    endpoint_name = 'tf-serving-ep-test-1'\r\n    tensorflow_serving_model = Model(model_data=model_data, role=role, sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session, image=image, framework_version='2.1')\r\n    tensorflow_serving_model.deploy(initial_instance_count=1, instance_type='ml.c4.xlarge', endpoint_name=endpoint_name)\r\n    rt_predictor = RealTimePredictor(endpoint=endpoint_name, sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session, serializer=json_serializer, content_type=CONTENT_TYPE_JSON, accept=CONTENT_TYPE_JSON)\n```\n\n4b. Create batch-transform job:\n\n```\ndef create_tfs_sagemaker_batch_transform():\r\n    sagemaker_session = sagemaker.Session()\r\n    print(sagemaker_session.boto_region_name)\r\n    role =

I thought about Glue but wanted to put data in DynamoDB where Glue does not seem to support. Also, Glue seems to be more expensive.\n* Put the data in DynamoDB with bike ID as primary key and timestamp as sort key.\n* Use SageMaker to learn with the DynamoDB data. There will be separate discussion on choosing which model and making time-series inferencing.\n* If we need to re-learn, it will use the DynamoDB data, not from S3. I think it will be faster to get data from DynamoDB instead from the raw S3 data.\n* Also, I think we can filter out some bad input or apply little modification to DynamoDB data (shifting time stamps to the correct time, etc.)\n* Make inferencing output based on the model.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you agree? Would you approach the problem differently?\nWould you rather learn from S3 directly via Athena or direct S3 access?\nOr would you rather use Glue and Redshift?\nBut the data about 100MB would be sufficient to train the model we have in mind.\nGlue and Redshift maybe overkill.\nCurrently, Korea region does not support Timestream database. So, time series database closest in Korea could be DynamoDB.\n\nPlease share your thoughts.\n\nThanks!",

        "Answer_body":"**Thoughts about DynamoDB**\n\nPer GB, DynamoDB is around 5X more cost per GB of data stored. On top of that, you have RCU\/WCU cost.\n\nI would recommend keeping data in S3. Not only is it more cost effective, but with S3, you do not have to worry about RCU\/WCU cost or throughput of DynamoDB. \n\nSageMaker notebooks and training instances can read directly from S3, and S3 has high-throughput. I don't think you will have a problem with 100 MB datasets. \n\nIf you need to prep\/transform your data, you can do the transformations \"in place\" in S3 using Glue, Athena, Glue DataBrew, GlueStudio, etc. \n\n\n**Glue and DynamoDB**\n\n> I thought about Glue but wanted to put data in DynamoDB where Glue does not seem to support.\n\nGlue supports both Python and Spark jobs. If you use a Glue Python job, you can import the boto3 (AWS SDK) library and write to DynamoDB.\n\n**Other strategies**\n\nHow is your customer ingesting the sensor data \/ how is it being written to S3? Are they using AWS IoT Core? \n\nRegardless, the pattern you've described thus far is:\n\nDevice -> Sensor data in S3 -> Transform with Lambda -> store data in DynamoDB\n\nAn alternative approach you could consider is using Kinesis Firehose with Lambda transformations. This will allow you to do \"in-line\" parsing \/ transformation of your data before it is ever written to S3, this removing the need to re-read the data from S3 and apply transformations after the fact. Firehose also allows you to write the stored data in formats such as Parquet, which can help with cost and subsequent query performance. \n\nIf you want to store both raw data and transformed data, you can use a \"fanout\" pattern with Kinesis Streams\/Firehose, where one output is raw data to S3 and the other is a transformed stream.",

This is fast, but also means that if you pass over your data multiple times, you have to re-read it again, on your dime (S3 requests and container wait times).\n\nPipe mode is still a good idea. For example if you have only few passes over the data and the data is rather large, so that it would not fit on an EBS volume.\n\nAlso, in PyTorch for example, data loading can happen in parallel.

        "Answer_body":"If I understand your log snippets correctly, it looks like your container is failing to respond to any `\/ping`s while processing the long-running request? Failing to respond to ping for an extended period indicates your endpoint is unhealthy so will signal SageMaker to restart the container.\n\nA likely reason for not responding might be if your request handling uses multi-processing in a way that maxes out all CPUs on the instance? This would leave no cores\/threads available to handle to incoming pings while the data is getting processed. In that case, the fix would be to identify what component(s) of your request handling might be using all available system cores at once, and re-configuring them to use `int(os.environ[\"SM_NUM_CPUS\"]) - 1` instead.\n\nA similar but less likely reason is if for some reason you're using a fully-custom serving stack or have explicitly re-configured the default one to have only one worker thread: In which case your main request handling might be blocking the server with no threads available to pick up concurrent pings (even though there are CPU resources)?",

        "Question_body":"Hi,  \nI'm moving my first steps in sagemaker. I'm using script mode to train a classification algorithm. Training is fine, however I'm not able to do incremental training. I want to train again the same model with new data. Here what I did. This is my script\n\n```\nimport sagemaker\r\nfrom sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow\r\nfrom sagemaker import get_execution_role\r\n\r\nbucket = 'sagemaker-blablabla'\r\ntrain_data = 's3:\/\/{}\/{}'.format(bucket,'train')\r\nvalidation_data = 's3:\/\/{}\/{}'.format(bucket,'test')\r\n\r\ns3_output_location = 's3:\/\/{}'.format(bucket)\r\n\r\ntf_estimator = TensorFlow(entry_point='main.py', \r\n                          role=get_execution_role(),\r\n                          train_instance_count=1, \r\n                          train_instance_type='ml.p2.xlarge',\r\n                          framework_version='1.12', \r\n                          py_version='py3',\r\n                          output_path=s3_output_location)\r\n\r\ninputs = {'train': train_data, 'test': validation_data}\r\ntf_estimator.fit(inputs)\n```\n\nThe entry point is my custom keras code, which I adapted to receive arguments from the script.  \nNow the training is successfully completed and I have in my s3 bucket the model.tar.gz. I want to train again, but it's not clear to me how to do it.. I tried this\n\n```\ntrained_model = 's3:\/\/sagemaker-blablabla\/sagemaker-tensorflow-scriptmode-2019-11-27-12-01-42-300\/output\/model.tar.gz'\r\n\r\ntf_estimator = sagemaker.estimator.Estimator(image_name='blablabla-west-1.amazonaws.com\/sagemaker-tensorflow-scriptmode:1.12-gpu-py3', \r\n                                              role=get_execution_role(),\r\n                                              train_instance_count=1, \r\n                                              train_instance_type='ml.p2.xlarge',\r\n                                              output_path=s3_output_location,\r\n                                              model_uri = trained_model)\r\n\r\ninputs = {'train': train_data, 'test': validation_data}\r\n\r\ntf_estimator.fit(inputs)\n```\n\nDoesn't work.. first I don't know how to retrieve the training image name (for this I looked for it in the aws console, but I guess there should be a smarter solution), second this code throws an exception about the entry point.. but it is my understanding that I shouldn't need it when I do incremental learning with a ready image..  \nI'm surely missing something important, any help?

Multi Model:\n        1. Model A is 6 GB\n        2. Model B is 9.4 GB\n    2. Runtime configuration:\n        1. ml.c5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 16 GiB memory)\n    3. Image responsible for handling the inference is of size 4.5gb\n2. The reason we have 4 endpoints is so that we can make concurrent requests to SageMaker. For this we have our load balancing logic that determines which endpoint to call.\n\n\nThis pattern will not continue working for us during 2023 as we scale up our survey ingestion pipeline. From running a load test of our system, the maximum TPS to Sagemaker we can support currently is 5.333; anything beyond that causes SageMaker to send 5XX responses (because we max out the CPU on all the available cores). Furthermore, our call pattern is of batch so there is no need for us to have the endpoints running 24\/7.\n\nFor 2023, we have predicted that we want to start handling a TPS of up to 200 during peaks. Before we start designing a new workflow to support this TPS, we wanted to get the SageMaker\u2019s teams\/community's feedback on alternatives. While we could try to scale vertically and horizontally this setup, we don\u2019t believe deploying bigger hosts and creating more realtime endpoints is the right solution in terms of total costs (given our intermittent batch call pattern to Sagemaker). Specifically, we want to know which Inference Flavor would better fit our use case based on the above description of the system.",

Unfortunately, compilation did not generate any error message nor log of any kind, so we are stuck.\nThe model is rather simple, but large, U-Net, with partial convolutions instead of regular ones, but otherwise no fancy operators.\nConversion of this model to torchscript is ok on the same instance.\nCould it be a memory problem ?",

        "Answer_comment_body":"Thank you for the answer ! Does that mean the type of EBS volume used by Notebook instances is fixed as \"General Purpose SSD (gp3) - Storage\" and has a pricing as per https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/ebs\/pricing\/ ? Which also means if the notebook instance's EBS gets updated from the default 5 GB to a higher value ( say 20 GB), we would be paying \"price\"\/GB-month * 20. When an notebook instance is requested, SageMaker, as a fully managed service, launches an ML compute instance and attaches a default Amazon EBS storage volume of 5 GB to it. You can configure the size of the EBS volume, but not the type. The pricing for said EBS storage volume is fixed, and specified per region in https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/pricing\/. As you mentioned, you will be charged per GB-month of provisioned storage. Got it, Thank you for the details. @jnavrro Thanks. Will that attached EBS be detached and terminated after Notebook Instance is stopped, so that account is not billed on anything after instanse is stopped?\n\nAlso curious, is there is a way somehow to view this attached EBS on a running Notebook Instance? I could not find it on the EC2 EBS Volumes list and have no idea where else all EBSs are displayed.",
        "Answer_body":"Hi there,\n\nThere is no option to select different tiers of EBS storage for SageMaker Notebook Instaces. According to the **Notebook Instances** tab of the [SageMaker Pricing Page](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/pricing\/), you pay a flat rate for a tier described as \"General Purpose (SSD) Storage\".\n\nHope this helps.",

The use case is to take final model (built by DS team) from S3 and do all sorts of Bias analysis using Clarify and upon acceptance of its response(Bias & Explainability reports) by Data Scientists, deploy to Model Monitor. Now, as there is no prebuilt Sagemaker template that caters to my use case, how shall I initiate this whole process and how shall I create a ML project at first place.\n\nAlso, how shall I initiate a notebook from within my cloudformation template for DS Team to kick off from Service Catalogue to automate the above process?\n\nAny pointers would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRegards,\nNikhil",

I haven't tried local mode, but I'll certainly give it a try!\n\nI think it's worth noting that I haven't used a pytorch container, and instead have only defined dependencies that my code runs upon. Would this cause issues? If so, would it be possible to point me towards some sort of documentation on creating a dockerfile\/image\/pytorch container since I've been struggling to learn about it online. Thanks so much.",

It's a general error, but I've faced it before when passing the inputs to the model incorrectly. What type of data are you trying pass through?\n\nA suggestion is to try run [Sagemaker in local mode](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/pipelines-local-mode.html). If you run locally, do you experience a similar error?\n\nTo help more, I'd need to see any further tracebacks, cloudwatch logs or more information on what you're trying to achieve.\n\nLet me know how you get on.\n\nCheers\nJames",

If the data types in the current execution are not the same as in the baseline dataset, this threshold is used to evaluate if it needs to be flagged as a violation.... Default value is 0.1 \n\n\nSo if datatype_check_threshold=0.1 and there is more than 10% data type is matching to requirement (corret data type), then there is no violation? Is that correct? \n\nThank you",

You can see its `Status`, `Short description`, `Modified by` as well as `Stage` it is currently deployed on.\n\nThis can be seen in the docs [here](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/model-registry-deploy-history.html) on the screenshot below the 5. point on that list.\n\nMy question is - how do we explicitly (or implictly) set the `Stage` of a given `Model Package`? I know that changing the approval status can be done by calling [update_model_package](https:\/\/boto3.amazonaws.com\/v1\/documentation\/api\/latest\/reference\/services\/sagemaker.html#SageMaker.Client.update_model_package) method. What about the `Stage`?\n\nIt magically happens when we use provided MLOps templates, but even after a thorough browsing of every generated file (SM Pipelines, CodePipeline, CodeBuild etc.) I could not find the exact API call. It probably has something to do with the `sagemaker:deployment-stage` Tag but setting it up on `Endpoint`, `Endpoint Config` or `Model` (the old construct of pre-2020 SageMaker that is still used by SageMaker Inference) did not work. You can't set tags on a `Model Package`.",

        "Question_body":"Hi,\n\nI am exploring the AWS sagemaker PySpark processor for data preprocessing (see [here](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/use-spark-processing-container.html)). We are in an NLP scenario, where we aim to process large quantity of texts in a distributed fashion. Locally, on a smaller test input our PySpark script runs fine.  Yet on the cluster, we need to install additional dependencies and models. \n\n**Questions**: \n1. Is there a reliable way to install python packages to all nodes in a cluster?\n2. Is there a way to execute initializations like `nltk.download()` once per cluster node?\n\n**What I tried** :  I read a variety of documentation and blog posts without finding a reliable way to install python packages:\n\n1. Using shell execution:\n it seems that the ugly fix of `os.system(\"python3 -m pip install <some_lib>)` works in the single node setting. However, as soon as the cluster manager distributes work to other instances, this does not work anymore.\n\n2. Trying to access `sc` without import and using `install_packages`:\nI assumed there is an AWS EMR container under the hood and was hoping to install packages this way. However, `sc` was not set \/ defined in my submitted script.\n\n3. Trying to access sparkContext via import and using `install_packages`:\nThe `install_packages` method is not pure pyspark but AWS EMR related. and does not exist.\n\n4. Using spark config to setup a virtual env with a requirements file (see https:\/\/gist.github.com\/geosmart\/3b345b4b335658fb05bb25f934a30723):\nThis does not work as I can't figure out if and at what location the `virtualenv` binary is installed inside the container. Thus when booting the cluster stops because it does not find the binary.\n\nSo, I've slowly being running out of ideas. But there must be a way to do proper initialization (and hopefully one that isn't too complicated)",

A few weeks later I have noticed the credit was charge $1 every hour and just realized that the Data Wranger auto-save the flow every minute. So, I deleted the unsaved flow and shut down all the services and instances according to advice on these two links :\n* https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/studio-lab-use-shutdown.html\n* https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/ex1-cleanup.html\n\nThen, I left the Sagemaker untouched for the whole month of May, and just got back to the console yesterday. This is what I found out for May's bill:\n\nAmazon SageMaker RunInstance $531.74\n==\n| Detail | Usage | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| $0.00 for Host:ml.m5.xlarge per hour under monthly free tier | 125.000 Hrs | $0.00 |\n| $0.00 for Notebk:ml.t2.medium per hour under monthly free tier | 107.056 Hrs | $0.00 |\n| $0.00 per Data Wrangler Interactive ml.m5.4xlarge hour under monthly free tier | 25.000 Hrs | $0.00 |\n| $0.23 per Hosting ml.m5.xlarge hour in US East (N.

Virginia) |  554.521 Hrs | $511.27 |\n\n\nSo, with another attempt, I installed an extension to automatically shut down idle kernels and set the limit to 10 min from advice here:\nhttps:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/machine-learning\/save-costs-by-automatically-shutting-down-idle-resources-within-amazon-sagemaker-studio\/ \nChecked the cost in usage report, it turns out that the service was shut down after installing the extension but then it revoked itself after 5 hours later (during my sleep time). There's still cost from Studio although with less charge than previous one. \n\n| Service | Operation | UsageType | StartTime | EndTime |UsageValue |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AmazonSageMaker | RunInstance | USE1-Studio_DW:KernelGateway-ml.m5.4xlarge | 5\/24\/2022 23:00 | 5\/25\/2022 0:00 | 1 |\n| AmazonSageMaker | RunInstance | USE1-Studio_DW:KernelGateway-ml.m5.4xlarge | 5\/25\/2022 0:00 | 5\/25\/2022 1:00 | 1 |\n| AmazonSageMaker | RunInstance | USE1-Studio_DW:KernelGateway-ml.m5.4xlarge | 5\/25\/2022 1:00 | 5\/25\/2022 2:00 | 1 |\n| AmazonSageMaker | RunInstance | USE1-Studio_DW:KernelGateway-ml.m5.4xlarge | 5\/25\/2022 2:00 | 5\/25\/2022 3:00 | 0.76484417 |\n| AmazonSageMaker | RunInstance | USE1-Studio_DW:KernelGateway-ml.m5.4xlarge | 5\/25\/2022 8:00 | 5\/25\/2022 9:00 | 0.36636722 |\n| AmazonSageMaker | RunInstance | USE1-Studio_DW:KernelGateway-ml.m5.4xlarge | 5\/25\/2022 9:00 | 5\/25\/2022 10:00 | 0.38959556 |\n\nDuring this time, I'm sure that there're no running instances, running apps, kernel sessions or terminal sessions. I even deleted the user profile. Last thing I haven't tried is to set up scheduled shutdown coz I think the services should not cause difficulty to our life that much. Any advice for any effective action to completely shutdown the Sagemaker instance?  Thanks.",

This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.\npipelines 0.0.1 requires sagemaker==2.93.0, but you have sagemaker 2.110.0 which is incompatible.\n```\n\nSo that seems like I can't upgrade sagemaker without changing pipelines, and it's not clear that's the right thing to do - like this project template may be all designed around those particular ealier libraries.\n\nBut so is it that the \"framework\" name should be different, e.g. \"tf\"?  Or is there some other setting that needs changing in order to allow me to get a tensorflow pipeline ...?\n\nHowever I find that if I use the existing `abalone\/pipeline.py` file I can change the framework to \"tensorflow\" and there's no problem running that particular step in the notebook.\n\nI've searched all the files in the project to try and find any dependency on the `abalone` folder name, and the closest I came was in `codebuild-buildspec.yml` but that hasn't helped.\n\nHas anyone else successfully changed the folder name from `abalone` to something else, or am I stuck with `abalone` if I want to make progress?\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\np.s. is there a slack community for sagemaker studio anywhere?\n\np.p.s. I have tried changing all instances of the term \"Abalone\" to \"Topic\" within the `topic\/pipeline.py` file (matching case as appropriate) to no avail\n\np.p.p.s.

I also notice that `conda list` returns very different results depending on whether I run it in the notebook or the terminal ... but the conda list results are identical for the two notebooks ...",

        "Answer_comment_body":"thanks Ivan for also taking a look at this question - very helpful indeed.  That \"self-service lab on Sagemaker Pipelines\" is exactly what I was looking for, although it doesn't mention the error message that I encountered above, and now for some reason am encountering again in the one notebook that worked yesterday - intermittent errors are of course the most frustrating :-( \n\nI will work through that lab from scratch after lunch, but I feel that I am missing something conceptual about the process by which a sagemaker studio project gets deployed.  Like that lab mentions pushing code the repo as a way to kick off a build, while the notebook itself seems to imply that one can kick of a deploy from the notebook itself.\n\nIs the problem perhaps that when I'm operating from within the notebook that it's only using the code that happens to be on the latest main branch? current feature branch?\n\nand why doesn't `python setup.py build` get the requirements in the right place for the pipeline?  Maybe it will be doing that if I just commit the code to the right branch?\n\nI'll work through the lab in a fresh project after lunch and see where I get to ... Hi, @regulatansaku.\n\nSee my comment below.\n\n> Like that lab mentions pushing code the repo as a way to kick off a build, while the notebook itself seems to imply that one can kick of a deploy from the notebook itself.\n\nThese are just two ways of doing the same thing. From the notebook you can try the SageMaker pipeline it in \"dev\" mode. When you commit the code, it will trigger a CI\/CD pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, which will run the same pipeline in the automated \"ops\" mode, without a need to have any notebooks up and running.\n\nFor the requirements problem, I tried to answer in [your other post](https:\/\/repost.aws\/questions\/QUdd2zOBY0Q4CEG1ZdbgNsgA\/using-transformers-module-with-sagemaker-studio-project-module-not-found-error-no-module-named-transformers). thanks @ivan - that's makes sense.  Just for some reason I get these random intermittent errors in the notebook trying to get the pipeline, the: `ValueError: Unsupported image scope: None. You may need to upgrade your SDK version (pip install -U sagemaker) for newer image scopes. Supported image scope(s): eia, inference, training.`\n\nBut so the workaround to avoid that issue appears to be to prefer to push the code to the main branch.  It's great to have a way to avoid that craziness so big thanks for that Hi, @regulatansaku.\nI'm glad that you've resolved your issue. As for the error about \"Unsupported image scope\" - check your code that you accidentally don't have `sagemaker.image_uris.retrieve` left anywhere. If you want to retrieve the TensorFlow image with this API, you need to specify either \"training\" or \"inference\" as a scope, because these two are slightly different images. But as I said before, you don't need to do that if you use the TensorFlow estimator, and not a generic Estimator.",
        "Answer_body":"Hi! I see two parts in your question:\n1. How to use Tensorflow in a SageMaker estimator to train and deploy a model\n2. How to adapt a SageMaker MLOps template to your data and code\n\nTensorflow estimator is slightly different from XGBoost estimator, and the easiest way to work with it is not by using `sagemaker.image_uris.retrieve(framework=\"tensorflow\",...)`, but to use [`sagemaker.tensorflow.TensorFlow` estimator instead](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/frameworks\/tensorflow\/using_tf.html).\n\nThese are the two examples, which will be useful for you:\n* [Train an MNIST model with TensorFlow](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/amazon-sagemaker-examples\/blob\/main\/frameworks\/tensorflow\/get_started_mnist_train.ipynb)\n* [Deploy a Trained TensorFlow V2 Model](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/amazon-sagemaker-examples\/blob\/main\/frameworks\/tensorflow\/get_started_mnist_deploy.ipynb)\n\nAs for updating the MLOps template, I recommend you to go through the comprehensive [self-service lab on SageMaker Pipelines](https:\/\/catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws\/workshops\/63069e26-921c-4ce1-9cc7-dd882ff62575\/en-US\/lab6).\n\nIt shows you how to update the source directory from `abalone` to `customer_churn`. In your case it will be the `topic`.\n\nP. S. As for a Slack channel, to my best knowledge, this re:Post forum now is the best place to ask any questions on Amazon SageMaker, including SageMaker Studio.",

Yes, you can write your own custom code through SageMaker studio.\n\n2. This may not be an apple to apple comparison. The main advantage in this context, is your able to scale out your training to multiple nodes and cores (if your underlying model supports that). Likewise you can scale out the deployment as well. Typically the studio notebook is backed by a lightweight EC2 instance, but there are a large range of EC2 instances for training on SageMaker. Please refer to the following links for further assistance. 1. https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/notebooks-available-instance-types.html 2. https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/ec2\/instance-types\/\n\n3. Please refer to the response above for question # 2.\n4. Did you mean semantic segmentation? If yes, the answer is yes too.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nRegards,\nPunya",

Usually when they connect with the snowflake-connector-python from their laptops they have to use authenticator=\"externalbrowser\", that opens a browser window and they perform the authentication with Azure AD. \n\nNow when we try to do the same thing in SageMaker it won't work as the snowflake-connector-python does not have a way to open a browser in this case. \n\nI was wondering if there was anyway to get a JWT\/ OAuth access_token with the current role, etc from Sagemaker (in the Sagemaker notebook) so that  we could use that to authenticate to snowflake instead.\n\nI mean something like in EKS IRSA where Kubernetes provides the pods with a JWT token generated by EKS itself or like GitLab CI_JOB_JWT_V2. \n\nIs there something similar in SageMaker? \n\nI come up with the following workaround but it's honestly a lot of work and would like to avoid it if possible: \n* Setup a secret per user in AWS Secrets Manager, the secret will contain a JWT signed by a private key controlled by me, the JWT is short lived (1 hour)\n* Setup secret rotation , to generate a new JWT per user every 45 minutes and update the secret in Secret Manager\n* Setup permissions for each secret so each user can only see their JWT and not the others\nThat way the users will have to fetch the current JWT from AWS Secrets Manager each time, and use that to authentiate to Snowflake (provided that I setup a Snowflake security integration for external OAuth, where I trust that JWT issuer\n\nAny one can come up with a simpler setup?  \n\n\nBest regards\/Rub\u00e9n",

When I run preprocessing (Tfidf), training and evaluating models locally they take under a minute, however when using sagemaker studio it has taken at least 13 minutes.\n\nI have been running an XgBoost model based on the Abalone pipeline example and running this with my data which is around 5500 rows of text data (the text data ~1.5k characters on average per example). \n\nThe below example shows multiple pipeline runs with a HyperparameterTuner and even with the **ml.c5.18xlarge** and the below hyperparameter ranges, I was only able to complete the pipeline in 14 min run time (this included pre-processing step, hp-tuning, model register and model evaluation). FYI even without the tuning it still took around 14 min.\n\nI was wondering if I am missing a trick here or is it just Sagemaker takes awhile to start?

It should have a dictionary with keys \"images\" and \"annotations\".

They don't have the knowledge to play with DeepAR and they are running tests in parallel with Amazon Forecast. Their questions are:\n\n1. Is it possible to use AutoPilot for Forecasting problems? (my answer would be yes, since regression problems can be solved by XGBoost, which also won a bunch of competitions on Forecasting)\n2. Which kind of pre-processing should the customer do and which pre-processing is done by AutoPilot which could simplify transformation of data for solving forecasting? In particular: are there any transformation to be done on the timestamp column? Should we introduce lagged entries - or is it done by AutoPilot?\n\n\nThanks to those taking the time to answer these questions :) \n\nBest,\nDavide Gallitelli",

        "Answer_body":"Although it is possible to model the forecasting as a regression problem in  Autopilot, there is no time-series capability built in Autopilot. So, you need to do the  preprocessing tasks such as time-series windowing, lag differencing, etc.  in order to generate the training\/test datasets  for the autopilot experiment.\n\nAdditionally, time series forecasting usually requires a model which can detect the pattern in a sequence of features.

        "Question_body":"I have a state-machine workflow with 3 following states:  \n\n[screenshot-of-my-workflow](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/4xJTE.png)   \n\n1. A 'Pass' block that adds a list of strings(SageMaker endpoint names) to the original input. (*this 'Pass' will be replaced by a call to DynamoDB to fetch list in future.*) \n2. Use map to call SageMaker endpoints dictated by the array(or list) from above result.\n3. Send the result of above 'Map' to a Lambda function and exit the workflow.\n\n\nHere's the entire workflow in .asl.json, inspired from [this aws blog](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/step-functions\/latest\/dg\/sample-map-state.html).\n```\n{\n  \"Comment\": \"A description of my state machine\",\n  \"StartAt\": \"Pass\",\n  \"States\": {\n    \"Pass\": {\n      \"Type\": \"Pass\",\n      \"Next\": \"InvokeEndpoints\",\n      \"Result\": {\n        \"Endpoints\": [\n          \"sagemaker-endpoint-1\",\n          \"sagemaker-endpoint-2\",\n          \"sagemaker-endpoint-3\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"ResultPath\": \"$.EndpointList\"\n    },\n    \"InvokeEndpoints\": {\n      \"Type\": \"Map\",\n      \"Next\": \"Post-Processor Lambda\",\n      \"Iterator\": {\n        \"StartAt\": \"InvokeEndpoint\",\n        \"States\": {\n          \"InvokeEndpoint\": {\n            \"Type\": \"Task\",\n            \"End\": true,\n            \"Parameters\": {\n              \"Body\": \"$.InvocationBody\",\n              \"EndpointName\": \"$.EndpointName\"\n            },\n            \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:sagemakerruntime:invokeEndpoint\",\n            \"ResultPath\": \"$.InvocationResult\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"ItemsPath\": \"$.EndpointList.Endpoints\",\n      \"MaxConcurrency\": 300,\n      \"Parameters\": {\n        \"InvocationBody.$\": \"$.body.InputData\",\n        \"EndpointName.$\": \"$$.Map.Item.Value\"\n      },\n      \"ResultPath\": \"$.InvocationResults\"\n    },\n    \"Post-Processor Lambda\": {\n      \"Type\": \"Task\",\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke\",\n      \"Parameters\": {\n        \"Payload.$\": \"$\",\n        \"FunctionName\": \"arn:aws:lambda:<my-region>:<my-account-id>:function:<my-lambda-function-name>:$LATEST\"\n      },\n      \"Retry\": [\n        {\n          \"ErrorEquals\": [\n            \"Lambda.ServiceException\",\n            \"Lambda.AWSLambdaException\",\n            \"Lambda.SdkClientException\"\n          ],\n          \"IntervalSeconds\": 2,\n          \"MaxAttempts\": 6,\n          \"BackoffRate\": 2\n        }\n      ],\n      \"End\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs can be seen in the workflow, I am iterating over the list from the previous 'Pass' block and mapping those to iterate inside 'Map' block and trying to access the Parameters of 'Map' block inside each iteration. Iteration works fine with number of iterators, but I can't access the Parameters inside the iteration. I get this error:\n```\n{\n  \"resourceType\": \"aws-sdk:sagemakerruntime\",\n  \"resource\": \"invokeEndpoint\",\n  \"error\": \"SageMakerRuntime.ValidationErrorException\",\n  \"cause\": \"1 validation error detected: Value '$.EndpointName' at 'endpointName' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must satisfy regular expression pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9](-*[a-zA-Z0-9])* (Service: SageMakerRuntime, Status Code: 400, Request ID: ed5cad0c-28d9-4913-853b-e5f9ac924444)\"\n}\n```\nSo, I presume the error is because \"$.EndpointName\" is not being filled with the relevant value. How do I avoid this.\n\nBut, when I open the failed execution and check the InvokeEndpoint block from graph-inspector, input to that is what I expected and above JSON-Paths to fetch the parameters should work, but they don't.  \n[screenshot-of-graph-inspector](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/3gXsM.jpg)\n\nWhat's causing the error and How do I fix this?",

        "Answer_body":"Hi,\n\nFirstly, you should not (usually) need to directly interact with S3 from your processing script: The fact that you've configured your `ProcessingOutput` means that any files your script saves in `\/opt\/ml\/processing\/output` should automatically get uploaded to your `s3:\/\/...` destination URL. Of course there might be particular special cases where you want to directly access S3 from your script, but in general the processing job inputs and outputs should do it for you, to keep your code nice and simple.\n\nI'm no Pandas Profiler expert, but I *think* the error might be coming from here:\n\n```python\n    output_path_tblforprofile = ('profile_case.html')\n    print(output_path_tblforprofile)\n    \n    profile_tblforprofile.to_file(output_path_tblforprofile)\n```\n\nDoesn't this just save the report to `profile_case.html` in your current working directory? That's not the `\/opt\/ml\/processing\/output` directory: It's usually the folder where the script is downloaded to the container I believe. The FileNotFound error is telling you that the HTML file is not getting created in the folder you expect, I think.\n\nSo I would suggest to make your output path explicit e.g. `\/opt\/ml\/processing\/output\/profile_case.html`, and also remove the boto3\/s3 section at the end - hope that helps!",

The same system works with `strategy ='SingleRecord'`, however I need it to be as efficient as possible. The main issue comes when I switch to MultiRecord with a small csv composed of two columns, both texts.\nWith a `max_payload = 6`, the process is succesfull with a CSV of 181 samples (609.7KB), but with the same CSV with 182 samples (621.6KB), the process fails with a `\"message\": \"Worker died.\"`. I imagined it had something to do with the memory limit of the instance I am using, so I switched to a `ml.m5.2xlarge` with 32GB of memory. \nWhen I switch to a `max_payload = 7`, suddenly the process works with the 182 samples of CSV (621.6KB), but it fails with anything bigger than that. Any ideas of what could be causing this?\n\nThe logs look like this\n\n2023-05-19T12:49:51.989+03:00\t2023-05-19T09:49:51,218 [WARN ] W-9007-model_1.0-stderr MODEL_LOG - Downloading: 0%| | 0.00\/8.68M [00:00<?, ?B\/s]\n\n2023-05-19T12:49:51.989+03:00\t2023-05-19T09:49:51,327 [WARN ] W-9007-model_1.0-stderr MODEL_LOG -

The hard limit on that is 4 apps per instance as of today. One more call out is that a user cannot run two instances of the same type, i.e., only one instance of any given instance type allowed per user profile (without using shared spaces).",
        "Answer_body":"Hi @yann_stoneman, you're right. Up to 4 apps can run on the same instances, so different kernels could still be run on the same instance. For example, a data scientist could be working on a tabular use case, and an image processing use case - so they might have a CPU and GPU instance running. Or they might use a larger instance for data processing or data wrangler feature. \n\nDepending on your data scientists' projects and use cases, I'd account for at most 2 instances per data scientist running concurrently. If your users already use SageMaker Notebook Instances, you can use the commonly used resource type as the Studio instance resource type for estimates - that way you can get a closer estimate to the actual costs. \n\nIf you're allowing for shared spaces (real time collaboration), include additional instances in your estimate - the users will now be able to use a private space through their user profile (unique to one user) and a shared space (this instance can be accessed across profiles). \n\nI'd also recommend using a plugin to shut down idle instances as a best practice when your teams are onboarded to Studio, so these instances are shut down if there are no notebooks actively running (ref: https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/machine-learning\/save-costs-by-automatically-shutting-down-idle-resources-within-amazon-sagemaker-studio\/)",

Is 'watch' given more weight than 'click' when training the model? In general, when there is more than one event type, do domain recommenders give more weight to some event types?\n\n2) In our use case, we have a platform that recommends video content. However, we have multiple event types, and some events need to be given more weight than others. Below is the list of our event types in the order of their importance:\n \nSHARE > LIKE > WATCH_COMPLETE > WATCH_PARTIAL > STARTED > SKIP\n\nSo when training the model, we would want 'SHARE' to have more weight than 'LIKE', and 'LIKE' to have more weight than 'WATCH_COMPLETE' and so on. \n\nI was looking into custom solutions. It looks like there is no way to give weights when using Personalize's custom solutions as mentioned in this [post](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/69456739\/any-way-to-tell-aws-personalize-that-some-interactions-count-more-than-others\/69483117#69483117)...\n\n---\n**So when using Amazon Personalize, should we use domain recommenders or build custom solutions for our use case?**\n\n**If we cannot give weights to different event types using Personalize, then what are alternatives? **Should we use Amazon SageMaker and build models from scratch? *Open to any and all suggestions.*\n\nThank you!",

        "Answer_body":"Hello,  \n  \nSo the issue here is the predictor.predict command converts the data to the format necessary for the endpoint to understand, thus you need to serialize or encode the payload by yourself. To do this you can work with something like json.dumps(payload) or for a byte array json.dumps(payload).encode().  \n  \n If you want to use the predictor class this is taken care of by the serializer option. The serializer encodes\/decodes the data for us and lets you simply call the endpoint through the predictor class. An example of this is the following code snippet:   \n  \nfrom sagemaker.serializers import IdentitySerializer  \nfrom sagemaker.deserializers import JSONDeserializer  \nserializer=IdentitySerializer(content_type=\"application\/json\")  \n  \nHope this helps!  \n  \nTo check out the various serializer options that can work for your different use cases check the following link.   \nSerializers: https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/api\/inference\/serializers.html  \n  \nEdited by: rvegira-aws on Jul 22, 2021 9:22 AM  \n  \nEdited by: rvegira-aws on Jul 22, 2021 9:24 AM",

        "Question_body":"Good morning, I am encountering an unusual issue with Sagemaker Autopilot. After launching the training on my dataset and completing the entire process without any problems, the best model is deployed, and the endpoint appears to be functioning correctly. However, the issue arises when I attempt to call the endpoint repeatedly. I observe that the memory usage rapidly increases until it reaches 97%. At that point, it either crashes with the error message \"worker died,\" and the CloudWatch logs indicate an \"OutOfMemory\" error in Java, or it remains operational but becomes congested. Upon reviewing CloudWatch, there doesn't appear to be anything abnormal except for the recurring message:\n\"The column 'column_name' does not exist in your dataset. Please specify a different column name for the 'Input column' that actually exists in your dataset and try again.\"\nThis message repeats even before I start invoking the endpoint. I'm uncertain if this is indeed the cause of the problem.",

The job needs to run on multiple GPUs (although at the current scale, multi-device single-node would be acceptable).\n\nFollowing [the docs](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/training-compiler-enable.html#training-compiler-enable-pysdk), I added the `distributed_training_launcher.py` launcher script to my `source_dir` bundle, and passed in the true training script via a `training_script` hyperparameter.\n\n...But when the job tries to start, I get:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/runpy.py\", line 194, in _run_module_as_main\nreturn _run_code(code, main_globals, None,\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/runpy.py\", line 87, in _run_code\n    exec(code, run_globals)\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/torch_xla\/distributed\/xla_spawn.py\", line 90, in <module>\nmain()\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/torch_xla\/distributed\/xla_spawn.py\", line 86, in main\nxmp.spawn(mod._mp_fn, args=(), nprocs=args.num_gpus)\nAttributeError: module 'train' has no attribute '_mp_fn'\n```\n\nAny ideas what might be causing this? Is there some particular limitation or additional requirement for training scripts that are written over multiple files?\n\nI also tried running in single-GPU mode (`p3.2xlarge`) instead - directly calling the train script instead of the distributed launcher - and saw the below error which seems to originate within [TrainingArguments](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/transformers\/v3.0.2\/main_classes\/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments) itself? Not sure why it's trying to call a 'tensorflow\/compiler' compiler when running in PT..?\n\n**EDIT: Turns out the below error can be solved by explicitly setting `n_gpus` as mentioned on the [troubleshooting doc](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/training-compiler-troubleshooting.html#training-compiler-troubleshooting-missing-xla-config) - but that takes me back to the error message above**\n\n```\nFile \"\/opt\/ml\/code\/code\/config.py\", line 124, in __post_init__\nsuper().__post_init__()\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/transformers\/training_args.py\", line 761, in __post_init__\nif is_torch_available() and self.device.type != \"cuda\" and (self.fp16 or self.fp16_full_eval):\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/transformers\/file_utils.py\", line 1764, in wrapper\nreturn func(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/transformers\/training_args.py\", line 975, in device\nreturn self._setup_devices\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/transformers\/file_utils.py\", line 1754, in __get__\ncached = self.fget(obj)\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/transformers\/file_utils.py\", line 1764, in wrapper\nreturn func(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/transformers\/training_args.py\", line 918, in _setup_devices\ndevice = xm.xla_device()\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/torch_xla\/core\/xla_model.py\", line 231, in xla_device\ndevices = get_xla_supported_devices(\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/torch_xla\/core\/xla_model.py\", line 137, in get_xla_supported_devices\nxla_devices = _DEVICES.value\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/torch_xla\/utils\/utils.py\", line 32, in value\nself._value = self._gen_fn()\n  File \"\/opt\/conda\/lib\/python3.8\/site-packages\/torch_xla\/core\/xla_model.py\", line 19, in <lambda>\n_DEVICES = xu.LazyProperty(lambda: torch_xla._XLAC._xla_get_devices())\nRuntimeError: tensorflow\/compiler\/xla\/xla_client\/computation_client.cc:273 : Missing XLA configuration\n```",

        "Answer_body":"Answer #1:  Based on the same technology used for time-series forecasting at Amazon.com, Forecast provides state-of-the-art algorithms to predict future time-series data based on historical data, and requires no machine learning experience. Amazon SageMaker Debugger profiles and debugs your training jobs to improve the performance of machine learning models on compute resource utilization and model predictions. So Debugger is available for your SageMaker training jobs but not for Amazon Forecast which is a fully managed service of its own.\n\nAnswer #2 - \nThe way to detect overfitting with forecasting is using \"backtests\", which are the \"train\/valid\" equivalent of traditional machine learning.  The reason Backtesting is used in forecasting is to keep the time order of the train\/valid data.  With careful analysis of backtest windows, you can have more confidence the model will generalize well with unseen data.\n\nAmazon Forecast now supports export of backtest forecasts as .csv files.  Customer can take the backtest forecasts and calculate whatever metric they want and\/or visualize.\n\n - Link to documentation:  https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/forecast\/latest\/dg\/metrics.html\n - Link to blog and notebook about using Backtests in Amazon Forecast:  https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/machine-learning\/amazon-forecast-now-supports-accuracy-measurements-for-individual-items\/\n\nOne common fear is backtesting will increase overfitting - it does not since each validation dataset is different from the previous backtest validation dataset.  To have more certainty about robustness of the model, use more than 1 backtest window.  If the Forecast Horizon is long, you may get by with just 1-2 backtest windows; otherwise use the maximum which is 5 backtest windows.  \n\nAnother concern is the increased training time since each backtest window is in fact another train\/forecast iteration.  It's a trade-off, if you want more model validation or not.\n\nIdeally, the wQL's of each backtest window are similar.  If you see all backtest forecasts with similar metrics (except maybe a few windows where underlying data had anomalies), that is good sign your model is not overfit.  \n\nBoth under-fitting and over-fitting for now are left to human judgement to examine backtest forecasts and decide whether model is acceptable or not.",

        "Question_body":"Hi MLOps Gurus,\n\nI'd like to seek guidance on my below situation.\n\nI am currently working on a Sagemaker project where I'm using the MLOPS template for model building, training, and deployment. I trained the model using the sklearn framework and registered it in the model registry. However, while creating the model deployment pipeline, I faced an issue with the default cloudformation template resources. Specifically, when attempting to use both the ModelPackageName and custom image as parameters for the model creation, I encountered an error. I discovered that Sagemaker expects a \"ModelDataUrl\" parameter when using a custom image. \n\nDefault Clouformation template:\n\n```\nResources:\n  Model:\n    Type: AWS::SageMaker::Model\n    Properties:\n      Containers:\n         - ModelPackageName: !Ref ModelPackageName\n      ExecutionRoleArn: !Ref ModelExecutionRoleArn\n```\n\n\nHow I modified:\n\n```\nResources:\n  Model:\n    Type: AWS::SageMaker::Model\n    Properties:\n      Containers:\n         - \n           Image: !Ref ImageURI\n           ModelDataUrl: !Ref ModelData\n           Mode: SingleModel #This defaults to single model change to \"MultiModel\" for MME\n           Environment: {\"SAGEMAKER_PROGRAM\": \"inference.py\", \n                         \"SAGEMAKER_SUBMIT_DIRECTORY\": !Ref ModelData}\n      ExecutionRoleArn: !Ref ModelExecutionRoleArn\n                       \n```\n\n\n\n\nMy question is: How can I retrieve the trained model from codebuild pipeline and add \"ModelDataUrl\" parameter  and dynamically pass it to the endpoint-config cloudformation template every time I execute the pipeline?\n\nPlease guide me the steps to progress, thank you!",

        "Answer_body":"SageMaker notebooks are Jupyter notebooks that uses the SparkMagic module to connect to a local Livy setup. The local Livy does an SSH tunnel to Livy service on the Glue Spark server. Apache Livy binds to post 8998 and is a RESTful service that can relay multiple Spark session commands at the same time so multiple port binding conflicts cannot happen. So yes, you can have multiple sessions as long as the backend cluster has resources to serve that many sessions.\n\nYou can run the following command in a notebook to check the defaults for Spark sessions:\n\n```\nspark.sparkContext.getConf().getAll()\n```\n\nI see the following defaults in my Spark session. You can easily override them from the config file at ~\/.sparkmagic\/config.json or by using the %%configure magic from within the notebook. \n\n```\nspark.executor.cores 4\nspark.executor.memory 5g\nspark.driver.memory 5g\n```\n\nNote that spark.executor.instances is not set and spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled is not overridden which means that it is true, so if you have a demanding Spark job in one notebook, it can take over all resources in the cluster and prevent other Spark sessions from starting. The recommendation when sharing a single Glue Dev endpoint is to limit each session to a few executors so that multiple sessions can acquire resources from the cluster e.g.:\n\n```\n%%configure -f\n{\"executorMemory\": \"5G\", \"executorCores\":4,\"numExecutors\":2}\n```\n\n(Note: Tested on multiple SageMaker PySpark notebooks in single SageMaker notebook instances as well as multiple SageMaker notebook instances.)",

I also have some python code using Tensorflow 2, that loads the model and handles basic inference. The models detect respectively faces and license plates, and the surrounding code converts an input image to a numpy array, and applies blurring to the images in areas that had detections.\n\nI want to get a SageMaker endpoint so that I can run inference on the model. I initially tried using a regular Lambda function (container based), but that is too slow for our use case. A SageMaker endpoint should give us GPU inference, which should be much faster.\n\nI am struggling to find out how to do this. From what I can tell reading the documentation and watching some YouTube video's, I need to create my own docker container. As a start, I can use for example `763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\/tensorflow-inference:2.8.0-gpu-py39-cu112-ubuntu20.04-sagemaker`. \n\nHowever, I can't find any solid documentation on how I would implement my other code. How do I send an image to SageMaker? Who tells it to convert the image to numpy array? How does it know the tensor names? How do I install additional requirements? How can I use the detections to apply blurring on the image, and how can I return the result image?\n\nCan someone here please point me in the right direction? I searched a lot but can't find any example code or blogs that explain this process. Thank you in advance! Your help is much appreciated.",

        "Question_body":"I want to enable data capture for a specific endpoint (so far, only via the console). The endpoint works fine and also logs & returns the desired results. However, no files are written to the specified S3 location.\n\n### Endpoint Configuration ###\n\nThe endpoint is based on a training job with a scikit learn classifier. It has only one variant which is a `ml.m4.xlarge` instance type. Data Capture is enabled with a sampling percentage of 100%. As data capture storage locations I tried `s3:\/\/<bucket-name>` as well as `s3:\/\/<bucket-name>\/<some-other-path>`. With the \"Capture content type\" I tried leaving everything blank, setting `text\/csv` in \"CSV\/Text\" and `application\/json` in \"JSON\".\n\n### Endpoint Invokation ###\n\nThe endpoint is invoked in a Lambda function with a client. Here's the call:\n```\nsagemaker_body_source = {\n            \"segments\": segments,\n            \"language\": language\n        }\npayload = json.dumps(sagemaker_body_source).encode()\nresponse = self.client.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName=endpoint_name,\n                                       Body=payload,\n                                       ContentType='application\/json',\n                                       Accept='application\/json')\nresult = json.loads(response['Body'].read().decode())\nreturn result[\"predictions\"]\n```\nInternally, the endpoint uses a Flask API with an `\/invocation` path that returns the result.\n\n### Logs ###\n\nThe endpoint itself works fine and the Flask API is logging input and output:\n```\nINFO:api:body: {'segments': [<strings...>], 'language': 'de'}\n```\n\n```\nINFO:api:output: {'predictions': [{'text': 'some text', 'label': 'some_label'}, ....]}\n```",

Can just run `sagemaker.get_execution_role()`\n- **Pre-built environments** for a range of use-cases (e.g. generic data science, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, etc) with libraries already installed, and **easy wiping\/reset** of the environment by stopping & starting the instance - no more \"environment soup\" on your local laptop.\n- Linux-based environments, which typically makes for a shorter path to production code than Mac\/Windows.\n- If you started using **SageMaker Studio**, then yes there are some native integrations such as the UIs for experiment tracking and endpoint management\/monitoring; easy sharing of notebook snapshots; and whatever else might be announced over the next couple of weeks.",

I have some initialization to do at creation time (clone a github repo, etc.).  That all works fine.  The only problem is that I would like to do this ahead of time in a set of accounts, and there doesn't appear to be any way to leave the newly-created instance in a `Stopped` state.  A property in the CFT would be helpful in this regard.\n\nI tried using the aws cli to stop the instance from the lifecycle create script, but that fails as shown in the resulting CloudWatch logs:\n\n```\nAn error occurred (ValidationException) when calling the StopNotebookInstance operation: Status (Pending) not in ([InService]). Unable to transition to (Stopping) for Notebook Instance (arn:aws:sagemaker:us-east-1:147561847539:notebook-instance\/birdclassificationworkshop).\n\n```\n\nInterestingly, when I interactively open a notebook instance, open a terminal in the instance, and execute a \"stop-notebook-instance\" command, SageMaker is happy to oblige.  I would have thought it would let me do the same in the lifecycle config.  Unfortunately, SageMaker still has the notebook in the `Pending` state at that point, so \"stop\" is not permitted.\n\nAre there other hooks or creative options anyone can provide for me?",

The service team is currently working on it, unfortunately I don't have an ETA as to when the feature will be released.\n\nLocal Mode is supported for frameworks images (TensorFlow, MXNet, Chainer, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn) and images you supply yourself.\n\n[Using the SageMaker Python SDK \u2014 sagemaker 2.72.3 documentation](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/overview.html#local-mode)\n\nIf you want to train Built-in algorithm models simply faster, you should check the recommendation in the SageMaker document.\n\nExample [Blazingtext-instances](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/blazingtext.html#blazingtext-instances), [Deepar-instances](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/deepar.html#deepar-instances)\n\nIf the algorithm supports it, one can also try using Pipe mode or FastFile mode.

        "Answer_comment_body":"Thank you so much Alex. I also found deep learning containers(DLC), but there was no container image for the BlazingText algorithm with inference code. The reason why I want to deploy BlazingText model on Fargate is to elastically respond to the varying workload on model endpoint. I think there are two options for my case: 1) selecting a proper instance type with auto scailing, 2) sagemaker serverless endpoint(preview).",
        "Answer_body":"To my knowledge, no - it's not generally possible to pull the [built-in algorithm](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/algos.html) containers outside SageMaker: Your easiest route would probably just be to deploy the model on SageMaker and integrate your other containerized tasks to call the SageMaker endpoint.\n\nIt's maybe worth mentioning that the [framework containers](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/docker-containers-prebuilt.html) for custom\/script-mode modelling (e.g. the [AWS DLCs](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/deep-learning-containers) for PyTorch\/HuggingFace\/etc) are not subject to this restriction (can check you should even be able to pull them locally): So if you were to use those to implement a customized text processing model I think you should be able to deploy it on ECS if needed. Of course this'd mean a more initial build and later maintenance effort though.",

It was not clear that GPT-NeoX is not supported, as this says decoder only architecture is a good-fit for inferencing and does not talk about model-specific architecture. Thanks for the response; this is helpful, and good to know there are plans to support this. I have a couple of  follow-up questions :\n\n1) Does the user need to wait for every new model\/architecture until the support is not out in transformers-neuronx SDK? Say, tomorrow, I want to switch from a Dolly to another LLM; as a user, can I compile the model and start using it similarly to the torch-neuronx examples? \n2) In transformers-neuronx, when we convert the model to a neuron model using model_neuron.to_neuron(). Can we store and load this model using torch.jit.save() and torch.jit.load() ?",
        "Answer_body":"There is a known issue with this model type that the team are working on and we will have a fix in an upcoming release of the [Neuron SDK](https:\/\/awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com\/en\/latest\/). Since this is a large model (7B params) you will need to shard it across multiple NeuronCores and we generally recommend using the [transformers-neuronx](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-neuron\/transformers-neuronx) library which provides Tensor Parallel and other features to assist in deploying Decoder based LLMs to inf2 based instances. Soon this library will also have support for GPT-NeoX which is the underlying architecture for this model.

The code that I've used:\n```python\nimport pprint\nimport boto3\nfrom sagemaker import get_execution_role\nimport sagemaker\nimport json\n\nendpoint_name = \"a-deployed-endpoint\"\nasg_client = boto3.client('application-autoscaling')\nresource_id='endpoint\/' + endpoint_name + '\/variant\/' + 'AllTraffic'\nasg_client.register_scalable_target(\n    ServiceNamespace='sagemaker', #\n    ResourceId=resource_id,\n    ScalableDimension='sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount',\n    MinCapacity=1,\n    MaxCapacity=5\n)\n\nresponse = asg_client.put_scaling_policy(\n    PolicyName='SageMakerEndpointInvocationScalingPolicy',\n    ServiceNamespace='sagemaker',  \n    ResourceId=resource_id,\n    ScalableDimension='sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount',\n    PolicyType='TargetTrackingScaling',\n    TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration={\n        'TargetValue': 20.0,\n        'PredefinedMetricSpecification': {\n            'PredefinedMetricType': 'SageMakerVariantInvocationsPerInstance',\n        },\n        'ScaleInCooldown': 60, \n        'ScaleOutCooldown': 10 \n    }\n)\n```\nTo confirm the policy has been configured correctly, I've double-checked with `describe_scaling_policies` method from ***boto3 sdk*** and on ***AWS console***.\n\nWith `describe_scaling_policies` method, we have:\n```python\nres = asg_client.describe_scaling_policies(\n    PolicyNames=['SageMakerEndpointInvocationScalingPolicy'],\n    ServiceNamespace='sagemaker', # The namespace of the AWS service that provides the resource. \n    ResourceId=resource_id, # Endpoint name \n    ScalableDimension='sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount', # SageMaker supports only Instance Count\n)\nprint(res)\n\n###### print's result ######\n{\n    'ScalingPolicies': [\n        {\n            'PolicyARN': \n'arn:aws:autoscaling:ap-southeast-1:***:scalingPolicy:c97d566f-50f0-4ac4-ac23-765a815095e9:resource\/sagema\nker\/endpoint\/jets-gpu-endpoint\/variant\/AllTraffic:policyName\/SageMakerEndpointInvocationScalingPolicy',\n            'PolicyName': 'SageMakerEndpointInvocationScalingPolicy',\n            'ServiceNamespace': 'sagemaker',\n            'ResourceId': 'endpoint\/jets-gpu-endpoint\/variant\/AllTraffic',\n            'ScalableDimension': 'sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount',\n            'PolicyType': 'TargetTrackingScaling',\n            'TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration': {\n                'TargetValue': 20.0,\n                'PredefinedMetricSpecification': {\n                    'PredefinedMetricType': 'SageMakerVariantInvocationsPerInstance'\n                },\n                'ScaleOutCooldown': 10,\n                'ScaleInCooldown': 60\n            },\n            'Alarms': [\n                {\n                    'AlarmName': \n'TargetTracking-endpoint\/jets-gpu-endpoint\/variant\/AllTraffic-AlarmHigh-bc06a793-369a-4515-8a7f-3cb5127455b6',\n                    'AlarmARN': \n'arn:aws:cloudwatch:ap-southeast-1:***:alarm:TargetTracking-endpoint\/jets-gpu-endpoint\/variant\/AllTraffic-\nAlarmHigh-bc06a793-369a-4515-8a7f-3cb5127455b6'\n                },\n                {\n                    'AlarmName': \n'TargetTracking-endpoint\/jets-gpu-endpoint\/variant\/AllTraffic-AlarmLow-9889edca-45f2-4f73-9f71-76cacf7b5882',\n                    'AlarmARN': \n'arn:aws:cloudwatch:ap-southeast-1:***:alarm:TargetTracking-endpoint\/jets-gpu-endpoint\/variant\/AllTraffic-\nAlarmLow-9889edca-45f2-4f73-9f71-76cacf7b5882'\n                }\n            ],\n            'CreationTime': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 26, 7, 3, 12, 714000, tzinfo=tzlocal())\n        }\n    ],\n    'ResponseMetadata': {\n        'RequestId': '56238668-ee84-4319-b2a9-8448cac98358',\n        'HTTPStatusCode': 200,\n        'HTTPHeaders': {\n            'x-amzn-requestid': '56238668-ee84-4319-b2a9-8448cac98358',\n            'content-type': 'application\/x-amz-json-1.1',\n            'content-length': '1341',\n            'date': 'Fri, 26 May 2023 07:03:14 GMT'\n        },\n        'RetryAttempts': 0\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith AWS console:\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMot2In7lQQJmvhZSsKhJy3g)\n\nEverything looks correct, right ? So I head to some load tests to make sure that the autoscaling works fine (for more information, I've used `locust` library to carry out the test). After 5 minutes, the endpoint starts encountering a bottleneck and also the high-traffic cloudwatch raises an alarm as the image below:\n\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMV5h9oeCbRmC2lJ3Lb2DtNQ)\n\nThe weird thing here is after 20 minutes since the cloudwatch raised an alarm, I don't see the endpoint scales out instances as expected, although I've tried to use a low target threshold and small scale out time. So, any clue or suggesstion to make the endpoint scalable?",

        "Question_body":"Hello there! I am creating a pytorch realtime inference endpoint using sagemaker. My folder structure is as following:\n\n```\nendpoint\n|_code\n  |_inference.py\n  |_requirements.txt\n|_model.pt\n```\n\nI am using a base docker image provided by AWS (`----.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\/pytorch-inference:1.8.1-gpu-py36`) which includes the pytorch version I need. The problem is, the python version is 3.6, and I would need it to be 3.8 because when I add other dependencies in the `requirements.txt `file, for example the `imageio `library, the endpoint fails to launch because the library doesn't work with a python version below 3.8. \n\nWhat is the best practice in this case for managing complex dependencies, where I need a custom python version, coupled with specific libraries versions? Should I create another docker image that has the libraries I need and the python version I require? If so, can I extend the base image to install python3.8, eg:\n\n```\nFROM ----.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\/pytorch-inference:1.8.1-gpu-py36\n\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y software-properties-common && \\\n    add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes\/ppa && \\\n    apt-get update && \\\n    apt install -y python3.8\n```\n\nIf I would then push this image to ECR and use it for inference, would it run torchserve and spin up everything needed for inference? Or do I have to add these commands to the dockerfile myself?\n\nI'm a bit confused on how to manages this and would really appreciate some guidance! Thank you so much!",

        "Answer_comment_body":"Thank you so much for your answer dear Christian! Appreciate it! I will try to extend the pre-built container and let you know. Do you know by any chance if there's any documentation \/ tutorial I can follow for it? Furthermore, can I generally assume that this approach is best practice? For example, in my work I often have the task to find suitable pre-trained ML models on github and implement them in endpoints. The repos generally share a conda environment with a specific python version and a set of libraries. In order for me to use these exact same requirements of python version + libraries, I would need to extend a pre-built container as mentioned above with the right python version and its requirements. Right?\n\nAnd this also removes the need to have a `requirements.txt` file alongside my `inference.py` file It will all depends on the specific use case. Baking the extra dependencies in the container increase the side of your docker image and bigger images can take longer to be downloaded for ECR. There may be scenario where it is better to install the libraries at run-time via a `requirements.txt`. Similarly for `inference.py` you might have a use case that requires you to just make changes to the model loading method (model_fn()) without the need to extend the pre-built containers. To sum it up, it will depends on the use-case.\n\nHere is an example of how to [extend our PyTorch container](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/amazon-sagemaker-examples\/blob\/main\/advanced_functionality\/pytorch_extending_our_containers\/pytorch_extending_our_containers.ipynb). Also have a look at the documentation [here](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/prebuilt-containers-extend.html)\n\nHope it helps. Sounds good, thank you so much! Appreciate your help!",
        "Answer_body":"Hello, you could indeed extend the pre-built Container and install your required Python version together with your other libraries. That way, everything needed for inference would be pre-install and you would just add the extra libraries that you need. I would run a test locally to see if that works for you. You could also see if your model can work with one of the [newer DLC images](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/deep-learning-containers\/blob\/master\/available_images.md) that comes with `python3.8`.",

Is it recommended that the weekends (1\/22, 1\/23) row is inserted to the dataset with NaN as the target_value?  \n\nQ2. If target_value for a timestamp is NaN, do the RTS attributes get ignored regardless of what value it is?  \n\nQ3. When the Forecast is training, does Forecast recognize that on Friday, the next value to predict is on Monday rather than on Saturday?  \n\nQ4. If an item_id has small time series data points (for instance, global start~end date ranges from 2018 to 2021, but a particular item_id only has data recorded for a couple months in 2020), should I front-fill & back-fill with NaN to match the global start~end range?

I have a script for online validation of the endpoint, and the F1 score is ~99%.

Number of columns in current dataset: 1, Number of columns in baseline constraints: 225\".\n\nGiven the results from the Endpoint and this Model Monitor constraint violation, I perceive there is a conflict between how the Endpoint is storing the data and how the Model Monitor Processing Job wants to consume the data.\n\nHere is one sample prediction from the jsonl file.

This is helpful to flag data quality issues. https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/model-monitor-interpreting-violations.html\n\nIn this case, however, this is an artifact of how we perform the analysis. We concatenate output and input CSVs into a single CSV to analyze the whole thing in one go. E.g. it would look like:\n\n```\noutput_col,input_col_1,input_col_2,...,input_col_n\n```\n\nIn this case, however, your output has a trailing newline which means that after concatenating this looks like:\n\n```\noutput_col # embedded newline in your output\n,input_col_1,input_col_2,...,input_col_n\n```\n\nTriggering the code to think there is only one column in dataset and hence failing the job.\n\nWe have a fix flowing through the pipeline now, while that goes out you can add a preprocessing script to your schedule to strip out the trailing newline from the output.

Hi Melanie, \nJust wondering if you could let me know if thers a preferable way to create a Sagemaker training job - should I go about it by using sagemaker.session.train(), or by creating an estimator (PyTorch estimator in my case) and then calling estimator.fit()\n\nMany thanks\nTim",
        "Answer_body":"Hi Tim, when you create a sagemaker training job using the estimator, the general best practice is to store your data on S3 and the training job will launch instances as requested by the training job configuration. As now we support fast file mode, which allows faster training job start compared to the file mode (which downloads the data from s3 to the training instance). But when you say you used sagemaker notebook instance to train the model, I assume you were not using SageMaker Training jobs but rather running the notebook (.ipynb) on the SageMaker notebook instance. Please note that as SageMaker is a fully managed service, the notebook instance (also training instances, hosting instances etc.) are launched in the service account, so you will not have directly access to those instance. The SageMaker notebook instance use EBS to store data and the EBS volume is mounted to the \/home\/ec2-user\/SageMaker. Please note that the EBS volume used by a SageMaker notebook instance can only be increased but not decrease. If you want to reduce the EBS volume, you need to create a new notebook instance with a smaller volume and move your data from the previous instance via s3. You will not be able to access that EBS volume from outside of the SageMaker notebook instance. The general best practice is to store large dataset on s3 and only use sample data on the SageMaker notebook instance (reduce the storage). Then use that small amount of sample data to test\/build your code. Then when you are ready to train on the whole dataset, you can launch a SageMaker training job and use the whole dataset stored on s3. Note that, running the training on the whole dataset on a SageMaker notebook instance will require you to use a big instance with enough computing power and also will not be able to perform distributed training with multiple instances. Comparatively, if you run the training job use SageMaker training instances, it gives you more flexibility of choosing the instance type and allow you to run on multiple instances for distributed training. Lastly, once the SageMaker training job is done, all the resources will be terminated which will save cost compared to continue using the big instance with a SageMaker notebook instance. Hope this has helped answer your question",

I assume , the train.py file here -> https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-sagemaker-build-train-deploy\/blob\/master\/08_projects\/modelbuild\/pipelines\/endtoendmlsm\/train\/train.py would be one i will customize. but once i change these files, how do i use them. how would i set up my custom template, create a product under my catalog? if yes, how to I link my custom train.py code to this new custom sagemaker project template. the documentation or samples only show how to use the prebuild templates under sagemaker project templates, but how do i get my own template pushed there ? can this be done via say cloudformation ?",

        "Answer_comment_body":"Hi @ivan thanks so much for replying, it's very much appreciated :-) \n\nSo you mention `setup.py` - as I described in my original question I have the dependencies added there already.  Please see the full contents of my `setup.py` at the end of this comment.\n\nYou mention \"requirements.txt file that you submit as part of your source_dir\".  I'm using the sagemaker studio default project template, and there's no requirements.txt file.  Naturally I can make one, but I am not personally submitting any source_dir.  There is a requires.txt file that's in the `pipelines.egg-info` folder, which contains the same as the setup.py\n\nThanks for the various links you shared, which point to putting requirements.txt in the source_dir that one passes in like so:\n\n```\ntp.run(\n    code='processing-script.py',\n    source_dir='scripts',\n```\n\nbut that doesn't seem to help me so much for sagemaker studio, as the place that transformers is first required is in the preprocessing step, which is not going to be calling that\n\n`setup.py`(subsection)\n```\nrequired_packages = [\"sagemaker==2.93.0\", \"sklearn\", \"transformers\", \"openpyxl\"]\nextras = {\n    \"test\": [\n        \"black\",\n        \"coverage\",\n        \"flake8\",\n        \"mock\",\n        \"pydocstyle\",\n        \"pytest\",\n        \"pytest-cov\",\n        \"sagemaker\",\n        \"tox\",\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n`pipelines.egg-info\/require.txt`\n```\nsagemaker==2.93.0\nsklearn\ntransformers\nopenpyxl\n\n[test]\nblack\ncoverage\nflake8\nmock\npydocstyle\npytest\npytest-cov\nsagemaker\ntox\n``` Hi, @regulatansaku.\n\nSee my comments below.\n\n> I'm using the sagemaker studio default project template, and there's no requirements.txt file.\n\nYou're right, you need to create this file and put it into `source_dir='scripts'`.\n\n> Naturally I can make one, but I am not personally submitting any source_dir.  \n\nThat's the reason, you need to submit a directory with at least two files: `processing-script.py` and `requirements.txt`. Put transformers both into `setup.py` and to `scripts\/requirements.txt`. In `setup.py` it's probably not even needed. The most important is `scripts\/requirements.txt`.\n\n> There is a requires.txt file that's in the pipelines.egg-info folder, which contains the same as the setup.py\n\nIt's not what you need. You can ignore it. Looks like this file is built from `setup.py` upon package installation and it's irrelevant to your processing or training jobs (neither `setup.py` nor this file are copied to your processing and training jobs).\n\nHope it now better clarifies my answer. Hi @Ivan, many thanks for that update.  \n\nIt's great to hear that I should ignore the setup.py.  I think I basically understand what you mean about putting requirements.txt in the source_dir when I get on to using the TensorFlowProcessor, but at the moment the error I get with 'transformers' is trying to use it in the preprocess step, before I each try to do anything TF.\n\nMaybe that's where I'm going wrong.  Maybe there's only a limited number of libraries available in the preprocess.py and actually that should be ignored for TF stuff, with the TF preprocessing going into some part of TensorFlowProcessor ...?\n\nFollowing your advice in the other post I've now been able to deploy via pushing to main, but I still get this error:\n\n```1664464168973 | [ 2022-09-29T15:09:28.973Z ] Traceback (most recent call last): File \"\/opt\/ml\/processing\/input\/code\/preprocess.py\", line 12, in <module> import transformers```\n\nYou've provided so much help already, and I'm sure you're exhausted by all my follow up questions, but I'm loathe to even try to implement TensorFlowProcessor without understanding how I can adjust what libraries are available to the preprocessing step.\n\nCan I not import arbitrary python modules during preprocessing like `import transformers` in my `topic\/preprocess.py`? Or is there some other secret technique for that? Hi, @regulatansaku.\n\nThe error that you posted for me indicates that you still missing the `requirements.txt` file with `transformers` as a dependency. You should put it into 'topic' dir so the source dir that you send to TensorFlowProcessor looks like this:\n\n```\n.\/topic\/\n    preprocess.py\n    requirements.txt\n```\n\nAnd requirements.txt should look like this:\n```\ntransformers\n```\n\nThen you create a processor like described in the section [TensorFlow Framework Processor](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/processing-job-frameworks-tensorflow.html):\n\n```\ntp = TensorFlowProcessor(\n...\n)\n\ntp.run(\n    code='preprocess.py',\n    source_dir='topic',\n```\n\nMy appologies that I've probably sent you a broken link to this doc earlier. Pay attention to the `requirements.txt` mentioned in the doc:\n>If you have a requirements.txt file, it should be a list of libraries you want to install in the container. Thanks so much for your further follow up @ivan - very very much appreciated.\n\nSo I have now tried this approach in two separate projects - both my own topic one, and in a customer_churn one created following the lab you sent.  In both cases I have put a requirements.txt file in the `pipelines\/<project-name>` directory.\n\nI am very familiar with what the contents of a requirements.txt file should be.  In both cases I have created the file by using the following command on the CLI:\n\n```\npython -m pip freeze > pipelines\/<project name>\/requirements.txt\n```\n\nI've commited the file to the main branch and pushed up.  In both cases I get the same sort of error:\n```\n1664541835894 | [ 2022-09-30T12:43:55.894Z ] ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transformers'\n\n1664541835894 | [ 2022-09-30T12:43:55.894Z ] Traceback (most recent call last): File \"\/opt\/ml\/processing\/input\/code\/preprocess.py\", line 22, in <module> import transformers\n```\nThe key missing info for me yesterday was that the `source_dir` is the `pipelines\/<project-name>` directory - that's clear now, thank you so much.  \n\nIs there some extra step required that we have overlooked?  Is there something about the transformers library that makes it impossible to require?  do we have an example repo of someone getting this to work with some other lib?\n\nI've also tried with a requirements.txt file with just \"transformers\", same issue.  Is there something else we need to do in sagemaker studio? Hi, @regulatansaku!\n\nThanks for additional info. From what you've explained, I think, the missing part is how you configure the SageMaker Processing job as part of your SageMaker Pipeline.\n\nTake a look at `pipeline.py`, in the default template it contains SKLearn Processor:\n```\nsklearn_processor = SKLearnProcessor(\n...\nstep_process = ProcessingStep(\n        name=\"PreprocessAbaloneData\",\n        processor=sklearn_processor,\n...\n```\n\nWhat you need here is to define `TensorFlowProcessor` instead of `SKLearnProcessor` with `sagemaker_session=PipelineSession()` - this argument is very important. Then you need to pass the result of `tp.run()` method into `step_args` argument, as defined in [the documentation for ProcessingStep](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/amazon_sagemaker_model_building_pipeline.html#processingstep). Your code will look like this:\n\n```\ntp = TensorFlowProcessor(\n    ...,\n    sagemaker_session=PipelineSession(),\n)\n\ntp_args = tp.run(\n    code='preprocess.py',\n    source_dir='topic',  # <-- HERE into this dir you put your `requirements.txt`. You may try to put BASE_DIR instead of 'topic', depending on your directory layout.\n     ...\n) \n\nstep_process = ProcessingStep(\n    name=\"MyProcessingStep\",\n    ...,\n    step_args = tp_args\n)\n\n```\n\nLet me know if it helps. thanks for your further help @ivan very much appreciated.\n\nI understand about making these changes for supporting TensorFlow, but I'm loathe to take them until I can understand how I can have arbitrary python modules available for the preprocess.py in the build pipeline.\n\nI happened to be interested in TensorFlow, but that's not my main concern (at least we have both XGB AND TF models that we need to train).  Can I infer from what you are telling me that that libraries that are available in the preprocessing step are a function of whether I use an SKLearnProcessor or a TensorFlowProcessor?  And if so what specifies the subset of libraries I can use.  I guess the requirements.txt in the case of the TensorFlowProcessor, but if I'm using the SKLearnProcessor then I can't adjust the requirements?  Or I need to use some other mechanism? Hi, @regulatansaku!\n\nThese are all great questions, I'm glad that you want to dive deeper. First of all, I'm recommending you to use TensorFlowProcessor, because it's [inherited from FrameworkProcessor](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-python-sdk\/blob\/853e4d80240e1255aa7437b1f84399beafbad493\/src\/sagemaker\/tensorflow\/processing.py#L29). And FrameworkProcessor in turn [supports `source_dir`](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-python-sdk\/blob\/853e4d80240e1255aa7437b1f84399beafbad493\/src\/sagemaker\/processing.py#L1455) where you can put your requirements.txt together with you processing script. But SKLearnProcessor [inherits from ScriptProcessor](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-python-sdk\/blob\/853e4d80240e1255aa7437b1f84399beafbad493\/src\/sagemaker\/sklearn\/processing.py#L29), which currently to my best knowledge doesn't support installation with requirements.txt. The workaround would be to call 'pip install' directly from your processing script, but with TensorFlowProcessor it's easier. In SageMaker there are multiple types of processors and they have their pre-built corresponding containers, e. g. [Spark processing container](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-spark-container\/tree\/master\/spark\/processing), [TensorFlow processing container](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-tensorflow-training-toolkit\/tree\/tf-2\/docker) and [SKLearnContainer](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-scikit-learn-container\/tree\/master\/docker\/1.0-1). They all will have slightly different set of preinstalled libraries. You may analyze them by either looking into the Dockerfiles or calling `pip freeze` from inside your processing script. \n\nTo understand more about SageMaker Processing, I recommend you to read the official [SageMaker Documentation](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/processing-job.html), [SageMaker Python SDK documentation](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/api\/training\/processing.html), as well as [SageMaker Python SDK source code itself](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-python-sdk\/tree\/853e4d80240e1255aa7437b1f84399beafbad493). thanks @ivan that makes a lot of sense. But so while the Tensorflow Processing Container allows us to add additional dependencies via requirements.txt, the SKLearnContainer does not?  fascinating ... Hi, @regulatansaku.\n\nAgree that it's not an optimal way at this moment. But I would not use the word \"doesn't allow\" or \"doesn't support\", because with SKLearn as well as with other ScriptProcessors you can achieve the same result with a little bit of manual configuration - call `pip install -r \/path\/to\/requirements.txt` from inside of your script by starting a subprocess. thanks, good point.  I do see in the SKLearn sagemaker docs that a requirements.txt in the build dir is also an option there https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/frameworks\/sklearn\/using_sklearn.html#using-third-party-libraries but I guess it's only for the main train\/estimator step, and not for the preprocess step?  Perhaps that's the case for all different containers - manual configuration required in subprocess if you want additional libraries to be available in the preprocess step ... My colleague pointed out a related thread on this https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-python-sdk\/issues\/1248 Hi, @regulatansaku.\nYou are right, good catch! There's an inconsistency in SKLearn estimator vs. SKLearn processor, described in the GitHub thread that you've shared. SKLearn estimator is inherited from Framework estimator, and hence supports `source_dir` parameter during training. Same as Tensorflow estimator. Tensorflow processor inherits Framework processor, and also supports `source_dir` for data processing. But SKLearn processor inherits ScriptProcessor and doesn't yet support the `source_dir`. So, if you want to use sklearn with the `requirements.txt` as a processor, just use any other processor that inherits FrameworkProcessor and install sklearn as a requirement with all additional dependencies that you need.",
        "Answer_body":"Hi! There are two places where you need to install the dependencies \/ requirements:\n\n1. In your environment where you execute `pipeline.start()` \u2013 can be Amazon SageMaker Studio, your local machine or CI\/CD pipeline executor, e. g. AWS CodeBuild. These dependencies are installed in `setup.py`.\n2. Inside the SageMaker processing and training jobs as well as in inference endpoints. This is usually done via `requirements.txt` file that you submit as part of your `source_dir`.\n\nIn your example, I recommend you to use the `TensorFlowProcessor`. The way how to install dependencies into it is described [in the corresponding section of the documentation](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/processing-job-frameworks-tensorflow.html), in particular:\n> SageMaker Processing installs the dependencies in `requirements.txt` in the container for you.\n\nSame applies to your model training and to the `TensorFlow` estimator.

I tried changing the security ingress and egress rule to allow \"All Traffic\" across \"All Ports\" too.\n\nThere are 2 visible problems I see. \n\n1. When I launch Sagemaker Studio from domain\/user-profile, it take over 20-30 mins to launch. Cloudwatch logs repeatedly show below errors:\nError: UnknownEndpoint: Inaccessible host: `api.sagemaker.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'.

This service may not be available in the `us-west-2' region.\n\n2. Eventually Studio launches. But when I create new notebook, Notebook Kernel fails to start with below error:\nHad error starting kernel 2 times.\nResponded with error: Connection timeout between notebook and kernel.\n\nI raised AWS support ticket too but the 1st customer support agent was not able to help by looking at all set-ups. Ticket has been escalated to next level but meanwhile I was wondering if anyone faced same issue in us-west-2?",

The Glue Spark environment comes with 1.4.1 version of scipy. So when you use the PySpark (python) or Spark (scala) kernels and you will get the 1.4.1 version of scipy.\n\nIf you use the default LifeCycle script that Glue SageMaker notebooks already come with, the connectivity to the Glue Dev endpoint should be in place. Note that the Glue SageMaker notebooks has a tag called 'aws-glue-dev-endpoint' that is used to identify which Glue Dev endpoint that particular notebook instance communicates with.\n\nThe Spark kernels cannot be replicated via the python shell. Those kernels relay Spark commands via the Livy service to Spark on the Glue Dev endpoint using a Jupyter module called Sparkmagic.\n\nRef: https:\/\/github.com\/jupyter-incubator\/sparkmagic",

        "Answer_body":"There are a few good practices that would ensure a robust model governance and tracking strategies in place. This is usually required by regulators especially in the financial industry and defined by frameworks like SR 11-7:\n\n**\u2022 Identify models, owners, and associated usage:** This is usually controlled by having a controlled landing zone for data scientists with clear authentication and authorization strategies to keep track of user activities and model owners.\n\n**\u2022 Cover all aspects of the model life cycle and MLOps:** By using an experimentation, proper documentation, feature tagging, testing, deployment environment and pipelining so that models can be independently validated by model validators without having to get back to model developers.\n\n**\u2022 maintain a centralized model inventory, and track the current validation status:** by keeping track of different model versions along with its associated risk and validation processes.\n\n**On-going monitoring for production models:** by implementing mechanisms to continuously assess accuracy, drift, building constraints on data feed used for inference and outcome analysis for different model versions.\n\nNow saying that, there are many tools out there to help in implementing and achieving all the above, which are scattered and can become challenge in implementation and integration. However, SageMaker have different modules to cover model of the practices mentioned above.\n\n- SageMaker Experiments: tracks all different steps of ML lifecycle in a construct called trial component. A bunch of trial components can form a trial and a trial belongs to an experiment. \n\n- SageMaker Pipelines: Help in building a re-producible experiment. Each stage of the ML Lifecycle fits in the pipeline and can automatically be tracked as Trial Components and tracked by its execution history.\n\n- SageMaker Model Registry: Builds a centralized catalog for models to manage different model versions, associate meta data with different version of models and manage approvals to enforce ownership.\n\n- SageMaker Model Monitoring: for managing data feed constraints, model performance analysis and drift detection.\n\n- SageMaker Feature Store: with proper tagging for feature groups and why certain features have been engineered by who is also a must.\n\n- SageMaker ML Lineage: which - from my point of view - is the most important component for model tracking, auditing and governance. SM ML Lineage is the glue that builds a graph to trace a certain model back to its origins. It can tell what Artifact contributed to which Trial Component and what data produced which model.",

        "Answer_body":"The underlying challenge here is that, while modern browsers can natively render PDFs, they require different embedding methods for PDFs vs images. To my knowledge there's no built-in [SageMaker Crowd HTML Element](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/sms-ui-template-reference.html) that's capable of handling both types interchangeably - and your experience with the pre-built UI seems to confirm this.\n\n### Displaying PDFs in A2I\/SMGT\n\n[This simple sample](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-a2i-sample-task-uis\/blob\/master\/text\/document-classification.liquid.html) suggests to use an `<iframe type=\"application\/pdf\">` to display PDFs via the browser's native renderer. You could try this approach... but as of ~March 2022, I found support was patchy because some browsers' default security policies didn't like loading a cross-origin iframe with interactive content.\n\nIf relying on the browser native renderer won't work for your users, you can use the open-source [PDF.js](https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/pdf.js\/) renderer instead. [Here is a more complex sample template](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-textract-transformer-pipeline\/blob\/0ac365f8e174d44337a5881a7dca6d61b94016cd\/notebooks\/review\/fields-validation-legacy.liquid.html#L24) that does that. PDF.js is powerful, but can be pretty tricky to get started with from my experience... Note that the basic process in this sample is:\n\n- Tag the `<script>`s and stylesheets for PDF.js in from a CDN\n- Include a [PDF viewer structure](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-textract-transformer-pipeline\/blob\/0ac365f8e174d44337a5881a7dca6d61b94016cd\/notebooks\/review\/fields-validation-legacy.liquid.html#L54) in your HTML\n- Pass your A2I object URL in [through JavaScript](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-textract-transformer-pipeline\/blob\/0ac365f8e174d44337a5881a7dca6d61b94016cd\/notebooks\/review\/fields-validation-legacy.liquid.html#L290) and set up your viewer there - including any interactivity you need\n- (The second inline script tag there you can probably ignore: It's specific to what that data that template collects)\n\n### Scaling template complexity\n\nAlthough the situation has improved a lot in recent years, writing direct-to-browser inline JavaScript in HTML can be tricky due to browser diversity and developer tooling limitations. If you want to build more advanced, interactive task templates, you might want to explore using front-end frameworks like React\/Angular\/Vue within A2I\/Ground Truth.\n\nThe above-mentioned PDF.js template is actually a legacy that's since been replaced by [this VueJS app](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-textract-transformer-pipeline\/tree\/main\/notebooks\/review) in the sample that uses it. In that case, the switch was made because we wanted to customize the PDF viewer (rendering detection boxes over the document), and the complexity of the app justified setting up a proper toolchain. You can find discussion there about using frameworks in general and VueJS in particular with A2I, and could use the app as a starting point for building your own complex template in advance. Note if I was re-building that from scratch, I'd probably use much **less** liquid templating, and implement more within the JS framework itself as discussed [here](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-textract-transformer-pipeline\/tree\/main\/notebooks\/review#can-vs-should-gaps-between-vue-and-web-components).\n\nYou can see the complex template being built\/deployed from (SageMaker) Python notebook [here](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-textract-transformer-pipeline\/blob\/main\/notebooks\/3.%20Human%20Review.ipynb), and a screenshot of it in action [here](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-textract-transformer-pipeline\/main\/img\/human-review-sample.png). This end-to-end sample is discussed further in an [AWS ML blog post](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/machine-learning\/bring-structure-to-diverse-documents-with-amazon-textract-and-transformer-based-models-on-amazon-sagemaker\/).\n\n### Handling mixed PDF\/Image content\n\nIf you need your template to handle both PDFs and images, this will add extra complexity. Could your JavaScript infer from the object URL (filename) which category the input object falls into, and dynamically set up either an `<img>` tag or a PDF viewer? Could you fetch the object from JS and check the `Content-Type` response header? Might it be simpler to add the file type as an input to your A2I loop, and pass it in that way? (e.g. using conditional liquid template to either render an `<img>` or not?)\n\nDepending on what points in the flow you know the file type, there are multiple different ways you might tackle this. Ultimately though, you'll probably be switching between either generating an img or a PDF viewer: Whether those HTML elements are created by static Liquid templating or by dynamic JS.",

        "Question_body":"Customer wants to host multiple DNN models on same SageMaker container due to latency concerns. Customer does not want to spin-up different containers for each model due to network adding additional latency. Thus, my customer asked me a question below -\n\n> Can one SageMaker host more than one model? Each model then share the\n> same input and produce different outputs concatenated together?\n\nI answered as below -\n\nYes. Amazon SageMaker supports you hosting multiple models in several different ways \u2013\n\n 1. Using Multi-model Inference endpoints: \nAmazon SageMaker supports serving multiple models from same Inference endpoint. Details can be found [here](1). The sample code can be found [here](2).  Currently, this feature do not support Elastic Inference or serial inference pipelines. Multi-model endpoints also enable time-sharing of memory resources across your models. This works best when the models are fairly similar in size and invocation latency. When this is the case, multi-model endpoints can effectively use instances across all models. If you have models that have significantly higher transactions per second (TPS) or latency requirements, we recommend hosting them on dedicated endpoints. Multi-model endpoints are also well suited to scenarios that can tolerate occasional cold-start-related latency penalties that occur when invoking infrequently used models\n\n 2. Using Bring your own algorithm on SageMaker\nYou can also bring your own container with your own libs and runtime\/programming language for serving and training. See the example notebook on how you can bring your own algorithm\/container image on sagemaker [here](3)\n\n 3. Using Multi-model serving container by using multi-model archive file\n      You can find a sample example here [4] for tensorflow serving\n 4. If models are called sequentially, the SageMaker inference pipeline allows you to chain up to 5 models called one after the other on the same endpoint\nSagemaker endpoints include optimizations that will save costs, such as (1) 1-click deploy to pre-configured environments for popular ML frameworks with a managed serving stack, (2) autoscaling, (3) model compilation, (4) cost-effective hardware acceleration via Elastic Inference, (5) multi-variant model deployment for testing and overlapped model replacement, (6) multi-AZ backend. It is not necessarily a good idea to have multiple models on same endpoint (unless you have the reasons and requirements I mentioned in Option A above). Having one model per endpoint creates an isolation which has positive benefits on fault tolerance, security and scalability. Please keep in mind that SageMaker works on containers that runs on top of EC2.\n\n[1]https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/machine-learning\/save-on-inference-costs-by-using-amazon-sagemaker-multi-model-endpoints\/\n\n[2]https:\/\/github.com\/awslabs\/amazon-sagemaker-examples\/blob\/master\/advanced_functionality\/multi_model_bring_your_own\/multi_model_endpoint_bring_your_own.ipynb\n\n[3]https:\/\/github.com\/awslabs\/amazon-sagemaker-examples\/blob\/master\/advanced_functionality\/scikit_bring_your_own\/scikit_bring_your_own.ipynb\n\n[4]https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/sagemaker-python-sdk\/blob\/master\/src\/sagemaker\/tensorflow\/deploying_tensorflow_serving.rst#deploying-more-than-one-model-to-your-endpoint\n\n[5]https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/inference-pipelines.html\n\nAm I missing anything?

My initial thought was that I would have a front-end basic webpage, that communicates with a REST API server on an EC2 instance. But since I started planning this out a bit more, I found a lot of info about various AWS products, and they seem interesting but it's all pretty over my head.\n\nI initially came the site because I heard about elastic inferencing.  After I researched elastic inferencing more, it seems like Amazon is encouraging people to use Inferentia2 instead. I realize that I could just do an EC2 instance, but I don't know how well that'll work for scaling if this app I'm making becomes popular. I've also read a bit about SageMaker, API Gateway, and even \"serverless\" options like Lambda, but I don't really know if those would integrate well with low cost inferencing products that AWS offers.\n\nAny advice on setting this kind of thing up?",

        "Answer_body":"This functionality of \"UPSERT\" type does not exist in CFn natively. You would need to use a Custom Resource to handle this logic.\nOne alternative that is not exactly what you asked for but might be a decent compromise is to use a Parameter to supply the endpoint if it does exist. Then use a condition to check the value. If the paramter is blank then create an endpoint if not use the value supplied.\nI know this is not what you asked for but it allows you to avoid the custom resource solution.\n\nSample of similiar UPSERT example for a VPC:\n\n```\nParameters :\n\n  Vpc:\n    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id\n\nConditions:\n\n  VpcNotSupplied: !Equals [!Ref Vpc, '']\n\nResources:\n\n  NewVpc:\n    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC\n    Condition: VpcNotSupplied\n    Properties:\n      CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0\/16\n\n  SecurityGroup:\n    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup\n    Properties:\n      GroupDescription: Sample\n      GroupName: Sample\n      VpcId: !If [VpcNotSupplied, !Ref NewVpc, !Ref Vpc ]\n```\n\nHere the `Vpc` input parameter can be supplied if the VPC you wish to use already exists, left blank if you want to create a new one. The NewVPC resource uses the `Condition` to only create if the supplied Vpc parameter value is blank. The Security group then uses the same condition to decide whetehr to use and existing Vpc or the newly created one.\n\nHope this makes sense.",

This is a docker container that runs a simple nginx->gunicorn\/wsgi->flask server\n\nI am facing an issue where my transform requests time out around 30 minutes in all instances, despite should being able to continue to 60 minutes. I need requests to be able to go to sagemaker maximum of 60 minutes due to data intense nature of request.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nThrough experience working with this setup for some months, I know that there are 3 factors that should affect the time my server has to respond to requests:\n\n 1. Sagemaker itself will cap invocations requests according to the\n    `InvocationsTimeoutInSeconds` paremeter set when [creating the batch\n    transform\n    job](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/APIReference\/API_ModelClientConfig.html#sagemaker-Type-ModelClientConfig-InvocationsTimeoutInSeconds).\n 2. The `nginx.conf` file must be configured such that `keepalive_timeout`, `proxy_read_timeout`, `proxy_send_timeout`, and `proxy_connect_timeout` are all equal or greater than maximum timeout\n 3. gunicorn server must its timeout configured to be equal or greater than maximum timeout\n\n\n----------\n\n\nI have verified that when I create my batch transform job `InvocationsTimeoutInSeconds` is set to 3600 (1 hour)\n\nMy nginx.conf looks like this:\n\n    worker_processes 1;\n    daemon off; # Prevent forking\n    \n    \n    pid \/tmp\/nginx.pid;\n    error_log \/var\/log\/nginx\/error.log;\n    \n    events {\n      # defaults\n    }\n    \n    http {\n      include \/etc\/nginx\/mime.types;\n      default_type application\/octet-stream;\n      access_log \/var\/log\/nginx\/access.log combined;\n    \n      sendfile        on;\n      client_max_body_size 30M;\n      keepalive_timeout  3920s;\n      \n      upstream gunicorn {\n        server unix:\/tmp\/gunicorn.sock;\n      }\n    \n      server {\n        listen 8080 deferred;\n        client_max_body_size 80m;\n    \n        keepalive_timeout 3920s;\n        proxy_read_timeout 3920s;\n        proxy_send_timeout 3920s;\n        proxy_connect_timeout 3920s;\n        send_timeout 3920s;\n    \n        location ~ ^\/(ping|invocations) {\n          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n          proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n          proxy_redirect off;\n          proxy_pass http:\/\/gunicorn;\n        }\n    \n        location \/ {\n          return 404 \"{}\";\n        }\n      }\n    }`\n\nI start the gunicorn server like this:\n\n    def start_server():\n        print('Starting the inference server with {} workers.'.format(model_server_workers))\n        print('Model server timeout {}.'.format(model_server_timeout))\n    \n        # link the log streams to stdout\/err so they will be logged to the container logs\n        subprocess.check_call(['ln', '-sf', '\/dev\/stdout', '\/var\/log\/nginx\/access.log'])\n        subprocess.check_call(['ln', '-sf', '\/dev\/stderr', '\/var\/log\/nginx\/error.log'])\n    \n        nginx = subprocess.Popen(['nginx', '-c', '\/opt\/program\/nginx.conf'])\n        gunicorn = subprocess.Popen(['gunicorn',\n                                     '--timeout', str(3600),\n                                     '-k', 'sync',\n                                     '-b', 'unix:\/tmp\/gunicorn.sock',\n                                     '--log-level', 'debug',\n                                     '-w', str(1),\n                                     'wsgi:app'])\n    \n        signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, lambda a, b: sigterm_handler(nginx.pid, gunicorn.pid))\n    \n        # If either subprocess exits, so do we.\n        pids = set([nginx.pid, gunicorn.pid])\n        while True:\n            pid, _ = os.wait()\n            if pid in pids:\n                break\n    \n        sigterm_handler(nginx.pid, gunicorn.pid)\n        print('Inference server exiting')\n\nDespite all this, whenever a transform job takes longer than approx 30 minutes I will see this message in my logs and the transform job status becomes failed: \n\n    2023\/01\/07 08:23:14 [error] 11#11: *4 upstream prematurely closed connection while reading response header from upstream, client: 169.254.255.130, server: , request: \"POST \/invocations HTTP\/1.1\", upstream: \"http:\/\/unix:\/tmp\/gunicorn.sock:\/invocations\", host: \"169.254.255.131:8080\"\n\nI am close to thinking there is a bug in AWS batch transform, but perhaps I am missing some other variable (perhaps in the nginx.conf) that could lead to premature upstream termination of my request.",

I do some very basic preprocessing and then I create a DaskDMatrix which does cause the task bytes per worker to get a little high, but never above the threshold where it would fail.\n\nNext I run xgb.dask.train which utilizes the xgboost package not the dask_ml.xgboost package. Very quickly, the workers die and I get the error `XGBoostError: rabit\/internal\/utils.h:90: Allreduce failed`. When I attempted this with a single file with only 17MB of data, I would still get this error but only a couple workers die. Does anyone know why this happens since I have double the memory of the dataframe?\n\n```\nX_train = X_train.to_dask_array()\nX_test = X_test.to_dask_array()\ny_train = y_train\ny_test = y_test\n```\n\n\ndtrain = xgb.dask.DaskDMatrix(client,X_train, y_train)\n\noutput = xgb.dask.train(\nclient,\n{\"verbosity\": 1, \"tree_method\": \"hist\", \"objective\": \"reg:squarederror\"},\ndtrain,\nnum_boost_round=100,\nevals=[(dtrain, \"train\")])`",

        "Answer_body":"Automated data labeling is labeling of data using machine learning. Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth will first select a random sample of data and send it to humans to be labeled. The results are then used to train a labeling model that attempts to label a new sample of raw data automatically. The labels are committed when the model can label the data with a confidence score that meets or exceeds a high threshold. Where the confidence score falls below this threshold, the data is sent to human labelers. Some of the data labeled by humans is used to generate a new training dataset for the labeling model, and the model is automatically retrained to improve its accuracy. This process repeats with each sample of raw data to be labeled. The labeling model becomes more capable of automatically labeling raw data with each iteration, and less data is routed to humans.",

Think of it like using that model hosted in SageMaker as a backend to my web app. \n\nI could create an API endpoint but my web app has a very simple solution for opening a web socket which I'd like to use. Question: **Whats the simplest\/best way to deploy the SageMaker notebook so that it keeps the kernel running and connection open?**\n\nThe websocket means I don't need to set up and configure individual API endpoints which is what all the documentation I can find suggests. \n\nThe desired workflow is:\n- Configure model in SageMaker notebook environment \n- Add a cell that establishes a websocket connection\n- Export notebook as a Python script (Maybe?)\n- Host & Run Python script on an AWS service\n\nWith the web socket I can simply establish the connection:\n\n`anvil.server.connect(app_key)`\n\nAnd then give each function that I want my web app to call a decorator. i.e:\n```\n@anvil.server.callable\ndef function(foo):\n  return foo\n```",

I'm not sure whether I'm just setting the job up incorrectly or whether this example is just not suited to distribution and was wondering if anyone has any ideas which it might be please?  \n  \nI'm using TensorFlow 1.9 because I think MPI\/Horovod doesn't work with 1.12 which I was using originally?  \n  \nIn my test I get these results with a batch size of 512:  \n1 Instance 1 GPU   13.5 global_step\/sec  \n2 Instance 1 GPU    7.3 global_step\/sec  \n1 Instance 8 GPU   18.8 global_step\/sec  \n  \nIf I reduce the batch size I get lower overall throughput, and see little benefit when increasing beyond 512.  \n  \nMy job specification looks as below and mnist.py is the file which comes with the examples, though I changed **batch_size=100** to **batch_size=512** in the script:\n\n```\nestimator = TensorFlow(entry_point='mnist.py',\r\n                  role=role,\r\n                  framework_version='1.9.0',\r\n                  training_steps=1250, \r\n                  evaluation_steps=10,\r\n                  train_max_run=5*60,    \r\n                  output_path=output_location,\r\n                  checkpoint_path=output_location,\r\n                  code_location=output_location,\r\n                  model_dir=output_location,\r\n                  train_instance_count=1,\r\n                  train_instance_type='ml.p3.16xlarge',\r\n                  base_job_name='PerformanceTest-p3-16xlarge-1-instance',\r\n                  distributions={\r\n                    'mpi': {\r\n                      'enabled': True,\r\n                      'processes_per_host': 8,\r\n                      'custom_mpi_options': '--NCCL_DEBUG INFO'\r\n                    }\r\n                  })\n```\n\nWhat I was hoping to see was a single 8-GPU instance hitting global_step\/sec of 70.2-97.2.

Both the images and that manifest are stored in an S3 bucket. When creating a project to train the model I noticed that the manifest contained some errors which I corrected manually (\"Start labeling\" then \"Draw bounding boxes\") but the updated manifest is nowhere to be found.\n\nI made sure to save the changes and when I browse through the dataset as it appears during the creation of a project I noticed that my changes were taken into account. I want the manifest so that I can store it locally on my computer but I can't seem to find it. Any help is very much appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

        "Question_body":"I've configured a model for async-inference, and its working correctly - I can submit a file via `invoke_endpoint_async` and download the output from s3.\n\nI'm now trying to configure auto-scaling. I'm trying experimentation with different options, but basically I want to configure 0-1 instances, have an instance created when`invoke_endpoint_async` is called, and have the instance shutdown shortly afterwards (along the lines of batch inference)\n\nI'm struggling to get it to work - I'm experiencing similar issues to https:\/\/github.com\/boto\/boto3\/issues\/2839\n\nFirst I think there's an issue with the `console` - if I  `aws register-scalable-target ...` it works but the console doesn't like the zero for `min-capacity`\n\n![Enter image description here](\/media\/postImages\/original\/IMWZdtU68ZSXSSvr46-_1nhw)\n\nI think this is just a UI nit though, I don't understand how the policy works - I have\n\n```json\n{\n    \"TargetValue\": 1.0,\n    \"CustomizedMetricSpecification\": {\n        \"MetricName\": \"ApproximateBacklogSizePerInstance\",\n        \"Namespace\": \"AWS\/SageMaker\",\n        \"Dimensions\": [{\"Name\": \"EndpointName\", \"Value\": \"***-test-endpoint-2023-03-24-04-28-06-341\"}],\n        \"Statistic\": \"Average\"\n    },\n    \"ScaleInCooldown\": 60,\n    \"ScaleOutCooldown\": 60\n}\n```\n\nThe first point of confusion was the console shows a built-in and custom policy. I was initially using the name of the built-in policy (SageMakerEndpointInvocationScalingPolicy) but `put-scaling-policy` doesn't appear to edit it - it creates a new policy with the same name.\n\nWhen I monitor the scaling activity ()\n\n```console\naws application-autoscaling describe-scaling-activities \\\n    --service-namespace sagemaker\n```\n\nI can initially see \"Successfully set desired instance count to 0. Change successfully fulfilled by sagemaker.\" \n\nBut when I involve the endpoint with \n\n```python\nresponse = sm_runtime.invoke_endpoint_async(\n    EndpointName=endpoint_name, \n    InputLocation=\"***\/input\/data.json\",\n    ContentType='application\/jsonlines',\n    Accept='application\/jsonlines')\n\noutput_location = response['OutputLocation']\n```\n\nI would expect to see the instance count increase to 1, then back to zero within a space of a few minutes. I have occasionally got it to do something but not reliably. I think the main issue is I don't understand the metric and how it interacts with the target.\n\nI've seen charts but I cannot figure out how to plot the \"ApproximateBacklogSizePerInstance\"? And how does it interact with \"TargetValue\"? What is the actual trigger for a scale in\/out?",

She did not know that she had been signed up, and it sat unused for 3 years. Last month, she got an email from AWS for \"unusual activity\" and she asked me to help her look into it. Someone racked up $800+ in charges in 10 days for AWS services she has never heard of, let alone used (SageMaker, LightSail were among the services). The card on the AWS account is a credit card that was stolen years ago and has since been cancelled. So when AWS tried to charge the card, it didn't go through.\n\nMy experience with AWS customer service has been unhelpful so far. Mom changed her AWS password in time so we could get into the account and contact support. I deleted the instances so that the services incurring charges are now stopped. But now AWS is telling me to put in a \"valid payment method\" or else they will not review the fraudulent bill. They also said that I have to set up additional AWS services (Cost Management, Amazon Cloud Watch, Cloud Trail, WAF, security services) before they'll review the bill. I have clearly explained to them that this entire account is unauthorized and we want to close it ASAP, so adding further services and a payment method doesn't make sense. \n\nWhy am I being told to use more AWS services when my goal is to use zero? Why do I have to set up \"preventative services\" when the issue I'm trying to resolve is a PAST issue of fraud? They also asked me to write back and confirm that we have read and understood the AWS Customer Agreement and shared responsibility model.\" Of course we haven't, because we didn't even know the account existed! \n\nAny advice or input into this situation? It's extremely frustrating to be told that AWS won't even look into the issue unless I set up these additional AWS services and give them a payment method. This is a clear case of identity fraud. We want this account shut down. \n\nSupport Case # is xxxxxxxxxx.\n\nEdit- removed case ID -Ann D",

        "Answer_body":"When [AWS Sample - BERT sample using torch 1.4](https:\/\/github.com\/aws-samples\/amazon-sagemaker-bert-classify-pytorch) was published, advance knowledge of the inference seems to be necessary.  If you use the PyTorch SageMaker SDK to create or deploy the model after it is trained, it automatically **re-packages** the model.tar.gz to include the code files and the inference files. As an example, when you use the following script, the model.tar.gz is repackaged so the contents of the src directory is automatically added to the code directory model.tar.gz, which initially only contains model files. You don't need to know the inference code in advance.\n\n```python\nfrom sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorchModel\nfrom sagemaker import get_execution_role\nrole = get_execution_role()\n\nmodel_uri = estimator.model_data\n\nmodel = PyTorchModel(model_data=model_uri,\n                     role=role,\n                     framework_version='1.4.0',\n                     entry_point='serve.py',\n                     source_dir='src')\n\npredictor = model.deploy(initial_instance_count=1, instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge')\n```\n\nFor the older versions, you couldn't include additional files \/dependencies during inference unless you built a custom container.

And then I also noticed that before the deletion the git status bar was permanently in \"Refreshing\" status.  After the deletion, it's quickly toggling between \"Refreshing\" and \"Idle\"",
        "Answer_body":"The most likely cause of this from my experience is a **(very) large number of active git changes**.\n\nGiven your \"current\" working folder (the one you're navigated to in the folder sidebar menu), the jupyterlab-git integration regularly checks if you're inside a git repository and polls for changes in that repository if so.\n\nWhen this list is very large, I've sometimes seen it cause significant slowdowns in the overall UI because of the way the underlying (open-source) extension works. This has been discussed before for example [in this GitHub issue](https:\/\/github.com\/jupyterlab\/jupyterlab-git\/issues\/667) - which is now marked closed but I've still seen it happening.\n\nFor example, maybe you (like me \ud83d\ude05) forgot to [gitignore](https:\/\/git-scm.com\/docs\/gitignore) a data folder or node_modules and generated thousands of untracked files there: You might see a significant slowdown whenever you're navigated to a folder within the scope of that git repo.\n\nSuggested solution would be:\n\n- Use the folder sidebar to navigate anywhere other than the affected git repository (e.g. to your root folder?), and you should see the slowdown resolve pretty much immediately if this is the underlying cause\n- Now the tricky task of finding and clearing up the problemmatic folder(s) without navigating to them in the folder GUI:\n    - You could use a System Terminal, `cd` to the affected folder and run `git status` to see where the many changes are hiding, if you're not sure already\n    - Add a `.gitignore` file (or modify your existing one) to make git ignore those changes. Because it starts with a dot, `.gitignore` is hidden by default in the JupyterLab file browser anyway. I usually use a system terminal to e.g. `cp myrepo\/.gitignore gitignore.txt` to create a visible copy (somewhere other than the repository folder which you're trying to avoid navigating to!) and then `mv gitignore.txt myrepo\/.gitignore` to overwrite with my edited version\n\nAlternatively (if e.g. it's a folder full of new files that you no longer care about like `node_modules`) you could just slog through the slowness to delete the problemmatic folder in the UI - but of course the problem would return if you re-created them later without `.gitignore`.",

        "Question_body":"Hi,  \nFrom my Host machine: **Nvidia GPU GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, CUDA 9.0, Ubuntu 16.04**:  \n  \n**I have compiled my docker image with:**  \n1) nvidia cuda 9.0 cudnn 7 devel (base image)  \n2) installed python2.7, darknet yolo (from PJReddie site)  \n3) built the darknet from source with options GPU=1, OPENMP=1, CUDNN=1  \n4) deployed Flask based RESTful service that gives prediction from Images (object labels and bounding boxes)  \n  \n**On this docker image:**  \n1) trained the Darknet model with my images data and created model weights file (yolov2.backup)  \n2) tested this model with test images, and it works  \n3) ensured that the darknet YOLO model utilizes the host machine's GPU  \n  \n**Then to use this custom image in Sagemaker, for inference:**  \n1) pushed docker image to ECR, created Model, Endpoint Config and Endpoint in Sagemaker  \n2) config = **p2.xlarge**, min instance=1, max instance=1  \n3) The\n `\/ping`\n and\n `\/invocations`\n requests ran without error E2E.  \n4) The RESTful client code was Python code from Sagemaker's Jupyter Notebook  \n  \n_**Issue I am facing is:**_  \n  \nThere are no predictions generated during execution and my webservice returns an Image in response, when requested by Python's 'requests' API. The image that I get in response, does not show any object's bounding box. I feel that the CUDA version on P2 instance is not matching the CUDA9.0 that is in my docker image. For CUDA to run properly, it is required that the host machine and docker's CUDA version should be same.  \n  \n_When I test my webservice and Darknet predictions inside my docker on my local Host machine, it runs fine, but not on Sagemaker!!_  \n  \n**Questions:**  \n1) Can you please tell me which CUDA version exists on the p2.xlarge instance? So that I can build my docker accordingly.  \n2) Please suggest some way to print debug information in CloudWatch logs from my docker image so that I am aware what is going on inside the Docker on Sagemaker env. The Flask webservice code doesn't allow any print statements. Hence each time I need to debug, I am creating a new docker image. A good way could save my time.   \n  \nThanks",

You can create a Step Function workflow that triggers the SageMaker inference endpoint and handles the processing of your videos. Here's a high-level overview of the approach:\n\nConfigure an event notification on your S3 bucket to trigger an AWS Lambda function whenever a new video file is uploaded. This Lambda function will start the Step Function workflow.\nDefine a Step Function workflow that includes a task to invoke your SageMaker inference endpoint for each video file. You can use the AWS SDK or Boto3 library in a Lambda function to call the SageMaker endpoint.\nHandle the batching or parallel processing of videos within the Step Function workflow, ensuring that the processing time stays within the allowed limits.\nConfigure the workflow to run automatically every night using a scheduled event (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Events).\nWith this approach, you can handle videos of any length as the Step Function workflow can span longer durations without the limitations of a Lambda function.\n\n**AWS Batch**: AWS Batch is a fully managed service for running batch computing workloads. It allows you to efficiently run large-scale, parallel, and high-performance computing (HPC) applications in the AWS Cloud. You can use AWS Batch to process your videos in batches, either as individual videos or as a group.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the approach:\n\nConfigure an event notification on your S3 bucket to trigger an AWS Lambda function whenever a new video file is uploaded. This Lambda function will create a job in AWS Batch.\nDefine an AWS Batch job that runs the processing logic for a single video or a group of videos.\nConfigure AWS Batch to handle the necessary resources and parallelism required for your video processing. You can specify the desired instance types and count to optimize the processing speed and cost.\nSchedule AWS Batch jobs to run every night using AWS CloudWatch Events or other scheduling mechanisms available in AWS (e.g., Amazon EventBridge).\nThis approach allows you to process videos in batches and efficiently utilize computing resources for parallel processing.\n\nBy utilizing AWS Step Functions or AWS Batch, you can overcome the time limitations of AWS Lambda and automate the invocation of your SageMaker inference endpoint when new videos are uploaded or on a scheduled basis. Choose the approach that best suits your requirements and workload characteristics.",

Could you please  advise me to create the JSON-format file for the categorical feature indices?  \nhere is more information of this mentioned JSON file provided there \n\n\n\" If the predictors include categorical feature(s), a json-format file named 'categorical_index.json' should be included in the input directory to indicate the column index(es) of the categorical features. Within the json-format file, it should have a python directory where the key is a string of 'cat_index_list' and the value is a list of unique integer(s). Each integer in the list indicates the column index of categorical features in the 'data.csv'. The range of each integer should be more than 0 (index 0 indicates the target) and less than the total number of columns.\" Hmm, reading the content there I *thiiiink* it means your file would look like e.g. `{ \"cat_index_list\": [2, 4] }` - if the 3rd and 5th column of your data.csv were categorical (Author just using the word \"directory\" where they meant \"dictionary\"?) But afraid I haven't tested that yet so can't be sure - would suggest raising it as a separate question if you still can't get it working, as that'll get more visibility! I used the same formatted JASON file and uploaded it to the same directory of train data ( data.csv), but still not working and raised another issue. I will make a new post and will copy-paste the question link here to pick your advice as well. I appreciate your guidance, Alex_T.",

        "Question_body":"Let's say I have trained an object detection model using Pipe and manifest files. Let's say I have the model artifacts saved as a .tar.gz as well as the model endpoint ready. Let's say also that the performance of the model is not enough and I have collected and labeled more pictures. I can create new manifest files that point either to the new labeled pictures only or to the global dataset of labeled pictures (I learned how to combine different manifest files into one).\n\nHow do I take my \"pre-trained\" .tar.gz model and keep training it using the new manifest files?\n\nWhat I have tried: \n1. Documentation (https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/incremental-training.html) seems clear that you cannot do what they call \"incremental training\" in Pipe mode and this alone seems to exclude using manifest files. This seems quite shortsighted because it would mean you have to train from scratch everytime, which can cost a lot.\n2. You can perform incremental training if you use RecordIO file and the \"File\" mode instead of Pipe. I followed several notebooks to create RecordIO files from the manifest files I already have. Not sure if I did it well but when I train, the performance metrics behave weirdly (figures show dots not connected to each other) and the model is SUPER slow to train (like taking several hours for a few epochs) to the point I had to stop it. It is likely I am doing something wrong in building the RecordIO files (but maybe not because the training job runs along) but the point is this approach is not user friendly and is error prone.",

Also, if I do the same thing with the same code, but switch \n```\nstrategy=\"MultiRecord\"\n```\nto \n\n```\nstrategy=\"SingleRecord\"\n```\nso the one code block would look like this\n```\nnl_detector = elec_model.transformer(\n                     instance_count = 1,\n                     instance_type = 'ml.g4dn.xlarge', strategy=\"SingleRecord\", assemble_with=\"Line\", output_path = \"s3:\/\/some_path\/trash_output\")\n```\n\nThe algorithm works correctly, and performs inference on all of the above sentences in the CSV correctly. Any reason why this is happening?\n\nEDIT 1:\nWhen I print the input payload it looks like this\n\n\n```\n\"joe annes rifle accesories discount\"\n\n2022-10-26T21:03:04,265 [INFO ] W-model-1-stdout com.amazonaws.ml.mms.wlm.WorkerLifeCycle - \n\n\"cute puppies for sale\"\n\n2022-10-26T21:03:04,265 [INFO ] W-model-1-stdout com.amazonaws.ml.mms.wlm.WorkerLifeCycle - \n\n\"Two dudes talk about sports\"\n\n2022-10-26T21:03:04,265 [INFO ] W-model-1-stdout com.amazonaws.ml.mms.wlm.WorkerLifeCycle\n```\n\n\nWhere each sentence is a inference example, and is separated by this statement\n\n\n```\n2022-10-26T21:03:04,265 [INFO ] W-model-1-stdout com.amazonaws.ml.mms.wlm.WorkerLifeCycle\n```\nSo it seems like sagemaker is separating the inference examples. But when I try and pass these sentences into a huggingface tokenizer, the tokenizer tokenizes them like they are one inference example, when they should be 3 distinct inference examples.",

        "Answer_body":"Yes, Sagemaker can use SSH for private repos. There are multiple options on how to connect to a repo in Sagemaker.\n\n** Option 1**: Using SSH to work with a private repo\nYou can follow the same steps you do in your local machine to connect to a private repo through SSH, steps to follow:\n    \n1. Open `Terminal` and type `ssh-keygen` to create an SSH key in your Amazon Sagemaker instance. \n2. Add the public key to your Git account (Github or Gitlab)\n3. Get the SSH url of your repo and git clone\n\n**Option 2**: Using AWS Secret Manager \nYou can follow the steps in AWS official documentation [here](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/nbi-git-resource.html). \n\n\n**Option 3**: Using GitHub with Personal Access Tokens **Recommended**\n\nLet\u2019s assume you have already generated an Access Tokens through the GitHub\u2019s Settings \/ Developer Settings \/ Personal Access Tokens page.\n\nYou can just simply go ahead and clone the repository using Studio UI. When it asks your username and password, you can provide your GitHub username and the Personal Access Token. If you want to cache your credentials avoiding to type it every time when you\u2019re interacting with the GitHub server, you can cache or store it on your home folder with the following command issued in the Terminal:\n\n``` $ git config --global git credential.helper [cache|store] ```\n\nIf you choose to store your credentials, it will be written to the `~\/.git-credentials` file located in your home folder. The \u201ccache\u201d helper stores the credential in-memory only and never lands on disk. It also accepts the --timeout <seconds> option, which changes the amount of time its daemon is kept running (the default is \u201c900\u201d, or 15 minutes)\n\nBefore you make your first commit, you still need to configure the git client to use your identity when we\u2019re checking in some new code into the repository. You need to run the following two commands from the terminal:\n```\n$ git config --global user.email \u201cuser@email.com\u201d\n$ git config --global user.name \u201cUser Name\u201d\n```\n\nSagemaker Studio is fully integrated with git and you can do it through the UI.",

        "Answer_body":"The extra `^M` symbol (i.e. Ctrl-M) stopped the whole scrip from being interpreted properly. \n\nThis issue is normally seen in scripts prepared in MSDOS\/Windows based system but used in Linux system due to difference of line endings.\n\nIn Unix based OS, lines end with `\\n` but MSDOS\/Win based system ends with `\\r\\n`\n\nIn Linux based system, you could show your prepared scripts by running\n```\ncat -e some-script.sh \n``` \nThe results would be something similar to\n```\n#!\/bin\/bash^M$\n... ...^M$\n```\n`$` is normal Unix end-of-line symbol. Windows uses an extra one `^M` and this symbol is not recognized by Unix system. That's why, in SageMaker Notebook Lifecycle Configuration, which is running Linux, your script was interpreted as `\/bin\/bash^M`\n\n\nTo mitigate the issue, please convert the scripts to Unix based ending and update life cycle configuration. To achieve this, you could use `Notepad++` in Windows. You can go to the `Edit` menu, select the `EOL Conversion` submenu, and from the options that come up select `UNIX\/OSX Format`. The next time you save the file, its line endings will, all going well, be saved with UNIX-style line endings. \n\nAlternatively, you could put the script in a Linux environment, e.g. EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2 and install `dos2unix` via `sudo yum install dos2unix`. After installation, you could convert your files via\n```\ndos2unix -n file.sh  output.sh \n```\nAfter the conversion, please update LCC with the new scripts.

        "Answer_body":"(As detailed further on the [algorithm details page](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/deepar.html#deepar-instances)), **yes**, the SageMaker DeepAR algorithm implementation is able to train on GPU-accelerated instances to speed up more challenging jobs. There's also a handy [reference table here](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/common-info-all-im-models.html) listing all the SageMaker built-in algorithms and whether they're likely to be accelerated with GPU.\n\n**However**, to be clear, it shouldn't be the *notebook* instance type that affects this... Typically when training models on SageMaker, the notebook would provide your interactive compute environment but you'd run training in *training jobs* - for example using the [SageMaker Python SDK](https:\/\/sagemaker.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/) `Estimator` class as shown in the sample notebooks for DeepAR [electricity](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/amazon-sagemaker-examples\/blob\/main\/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms\/deepar_electricity\/DeepAR-Electricity.ipynb) and [synthetic](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/amazon-sagemaker-examples\/blob\/main\/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms\/deepar_synthetic\/deepar_synthetic.ipynb). The instance type you select for training is independent of the instance type you use for your notebook - for example in the electricity notebook it's set as follows:\n\n```python\nestimator = sagemaker.estimator.Estimator(\n    image_uri=image_name,\n    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,\n    role=role,\n    train_instance_count=1,  # <-- Setting training instance count\n    train_instance_type=\"ml.c4.2xlarge\",  # <-- Setting training instance type\n    base_job_name=\"deepar-electricity-demo\",\n    output_path=s3_output_path,\n)\n```\n\nSo normally I wouldn't expect you to need to change your *notebook* instance type to speed up training - just edit the configuration of your training job from within the notebook.\n\nSuggesting a particular type is tricky because [DeepAR hyperparameters](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/deepar_hyperparameters.html) like `context_length`, `embedding_dimension`, and `mini_batch_size` will affect how much GPU capacity is needed for a particular run. Since you're coming from CPU-only baseline, I'd maybe suggest to start small with trying out single-GPU `g4dn.xlarge`, `g5.xlarge` or `p3.2xlarge` instances, perhaps starting with the lowest cost-per-hour? You can keep  an eye on your jobs' GPUUtilization and GPUMemoryUtilization metrics to check whether utilization is low on instances like p3 with \"bigger\" GPUs. Increasing `mini_batch_size` should help fill extra capacity on these and complete your job faster, but it will probably affect model convergence - so may need to tune other parameters like `learning_rate` to try and compensate. So considering all of this, you may find trade-offs between speed and total cost, or speed and accuracy, for good hyperparameter combinations on your dataset. Of course you could also scale up to multi-GPU instance types if you'd like to accelerate further.\n\nIf I understood right you're also using SageMaker Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning to search these parameters, something like [this XGBoost notebook](https:\/\/github.com\/aws\/amazon-sagemaker-examples\/blob\/main\/hyperparameter_tuning\/xgboost_random_log\/hpo_xgboost_random_log.ipynb) with the `HyperparameterTuner` class?\n\nIn that case would also mention:\n- Increasing the `max_parallel_jobs` parameter may accelerate the overall run time (by running more of the individual training jobs in parallel) - with a trade-off on how much information is available when each training job in the budget is kicked off.\n- If you're planning to run this training regularly on a dataset which evolves over time, you probably don't need to run HPO each time: Will likely see good results using your previously-optimized hyperparameters, unless something materially changes in the nature of the data and patterns.",

The model isn't big, so this is simple.\n2. Retrieval: The ML model first retrieves information from a database using ANN algorithm(like Annoy or Scann). The database needs to be loaded into memory at all times for really fast inference. However, the database is big(around 500GB). What is the best way to deploy this database? Is Sagemaker the best bet?",

        "Question_body":"I'd like to host models which need to use BLS on GPU-backed realtime inference with MME. I'd like to be able to scale to hundreds or thousands of such models behind one endpoint. Will this work out of the box? I know there is support for this for models which don't use BLS, but the documentation is not clear on whether an entire BLS pipeline can be treated as an individual model by the auto-scaler.\n\n\nBetter description of my use case: \n\nThe model consists of:\n- Model slice A: weights selected from a set of ~5 options, called once per invocation, nothing ever gets added or removed\n- Model slice B: weights selected from a set of 100s+ options, called in a loop n times per invocation, variants constantly added\n\n\nSo if you take this model alone, it seems to be a good candidate for Triton BLS, where each of the slices is a model instance and slice B instance is called n times in a loop in the pipeline file.\n\n\nMy first thought was to add all the model variants to a single BLS model repo, but I am not sure if this would work with auto-scaling and frequently added new models. \n\n\nThe other possibility is to split it into m BLS pipelines, where m is the number of variants I have for model slice B. This should work with auto-scaling, since the model target should match up with the request destination model, but I am not sure if this is supported (an entire BLS model hierarchy being loaded and unloaded in Sagemaker).\n\n\nThe next best option I guess is to not use MME? And maybe switch to MCE? But this seems like a big loss in performance.\n\n\nWhat is the best way to deploy this model using Sagemaker tools?",

        "Question_body":"Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler reduces the time it takes to aggregate and prepare data for machine learning (ML) from weeks to minutes in Amazon SageMaker Studio, the first fully integrated development environment (IDE) for ML. With SageMaker Data Wrangler, you can simplify the process of data preparation and feature engineering, and complete each step of the data preparation workflow, including data selection, cleansing, exploration, and visualization, from a single visual interface. SageMaker Data Wrangler runs on ml.m5.4xlarge by default. SageMaker Data Wrangler includes built-in data transforms and analyses written in PySpark so you can process large data sets (up to hundreds of gigabytes (GB) of data) efficiently on the default instance. \n\nStarting today, you can use additional M5 or R5 instance types with more CPU or memory in SageMaker Data Wrangler to improve performance for your data preparation workloads. Amazon EC2 M5 instances offer a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources for a broad range of workloads. Amazon EC2 R5 instances are the memory optimized instances. Both M5 and R5 instance types are well suited for CPU and memory intensive applications such as running built-in transforms for very large data sets (up to terabytes (TB) of data) or applying custom transforms written in Panda on medium data sets (up to tens of GBs).\n\nTo learn more about the newly supported instances with Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, visit the [blog ](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/machine-learning\/process-larger-and-wider-datasets-with-amazon-sagemaker-data-wrangler\/) or the [AWS document](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/latest\/dg\/data-wrangler-data-flow.html), and the[ pricing page](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/sagemaker\/pricing\/).

I have tried all of:\n- `Sagemaker Studio > Trial components > charts`. It is only possible to plot things like `learning-rate_min` (i.e. a point value not a time-series metric)\n- `SageMaker aws console > training > training jobs > <select job> > Scroll to Monitor section`.
