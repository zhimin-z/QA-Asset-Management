I have approached this with reference ration by taking a credit card\/ debit card and then calculating the value. \r\n\r\nFor this I have a custom object detector model that I created using YOLO v8, on top of it found the centre of the pupil and now I am trying to calculate the final value. However, the model is very inconsistent and also the accuracy I am getting with this model is varying between 0.5mm to 4mm. I am looking for precision of less than or at max equal to 1mm.\r\n\r\nI also tried with capturing 15 images and then averaging it out to get the final calculation. However, none of this is helping me here. Any help here is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nViswanath",

It was a fantastic and jam-packed event with customers, partners, colleagues, and community members sharing how they leverage H2O.ai to accelerate and transform AI lifecycles. I wanted to share some of my notes and learnings here for folks who couldn't make it live.\r\n\r\n**AI Leaders from\u00a0AT&T**\u00a0-\u00a0Mark Austin,\u00a0Mike Berry,\u00a0Prince Paulraj,\u00a0Alan Gray, and\u00a0Robert Woods, Jr, PMP\u00a0shared their vision about AI as a Service and Feature Store a co-innovation from AT&T and H2O.ai. Later Prince & I went on stage with\u00a0Jakub H\u00e1va\u00a0to talk about all the new updates from Feature Store.\r\n\r\n**Sean Otto, Phd. talked about how\u00a0AES New York Renewable Energy Co**\u00a0is using AI for use cases in power generation, Utilities, Commercial trading, and Energy Trading. He shared the AES philosophy on delivering value to the organization.\u00a0\r\n\r\n**Shailesh Kumar, the Chief Data Scientist from\u00a0Reliance Industries**\u00a0gave a rich talk about digitization and a holistic eight-layered AI stack - Interpretation, Causality, Prediction, Explanation, Controllability, Simulation, Optimization & Adaption.\u00a0\r\n\r\n**Jeremy Elster\u00a0from\u00a0Chipotle Mexican Grill**\u00a0shared exciting insights about Building the Data and ML Products at Chipotle with H2O Driverless AI - An AutoML solution to build models with speed.\u00a0\r\n\r\n**Karamjit Singh, Director of AI at\u00a0Mastercard**\u00a0talked about using AI-driven fraud prevention, transaction processing, and payment optimization.\r\n\r\n**Nikolaos Vardakis**\u00a0talked about an interesting use-case of Revenue management Growth at\u00a0Suntory Beverage & Food Europe\u00a0\r\n\r\n**Jennifer Steffens\u00a0from\u00a0Hy-Vee**\u00a0discussed how innovation in the AI landscape goes hand in hand with the rapidly evolving Retail Landscape\u00a0\r\n\r\n**Mi Yan\u00a0and\u00a0Jolene Huang\u00a0from the data science team at\u00a0Intuit**\u00a0shared about incredible automation they have done in ML Platform, how they enabled the capability to use AutoML provided by H2O DriverlessAI to build new models\u00a0\r\n\r\nFinally, we ended the day with a very heartfelt remembrance and celebration of the life of our dear colleague and friend, Dr.Leland Wilkinson.\u00a0Jan Gamec\u00a0performed and gave a wonderful tribute that left everyone teary-eyed. Leland's legacy lives on through all his contributions to science, math, technology, and art. At H2O.ai, we wanted to honor him by open-sourcing AutoViz and announcing a Leland Wilkison award.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI want to thank everyone for making the event so memorable. I'm really looking forward to the next H2O World!\r\n\r\nYou can also [see my LinkedIn post here](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:7001341305943465984\/) - there are pictures of the event included there.
